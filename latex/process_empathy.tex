\section{Process Empathy\label{sec:process-empathy}}

Empathy typically refers to understanding the emotions of another person. A distinct form of empathy is the ability to understand the reasoning another person uses. To distinguish these types of empathy I'll call them emotional empathy and \hyperref[sec:intellectual-empathy]{intellectual empathy}. A third form of empathy is the ability to perceive why individuals working together behave in recurring patterns. 

Reasoning about a process is slightly different -- reasoning assumes a holistic external view, whereas process empathy is about the perspective of individual people operating within their local context.

Process empathy is comprised of thinking beyond both (professional relationships with individuals) and (the abstraction of ``team as entity"). 
You can gain insight about people you don't know doing work you don't understand.

Applying the paradigm of process empathy helps you answer questions like
\begin{itemize}
    \item Why is this taking so long? So apparently inefficient?
\hyperref[sec:unavoidable-hazards]{unavoidable hazards}
    \item Why are people under trained?\\
\textit{Answer}: constant \hyperref[sec:turnover]{turnover}
    \item What incentives do process participants face?
\textit{Answer}:  \hyperref[sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples]{feedback loops}, lack thereof
    \item What unaligned goals do individuals have that cause friction?
    \item What are the different paths individuals take to work towards their goals?
\textit{Answer}:  \hyperref[sec:dilemma-trilemma]{dilemmas}
    \item How to leverage the interplay between processes and interpersonal professional relationships
\textit{Answer}:  \hyperref[sec:reputation]{reputation}
    \item Which patterns are specific to the people involved versus the organization versus every generic organization?
\textit{Answer}: 
\end{itemize}

The paradigm of process empathy :
Identify rules (written and unwritten), who enforces what, detection mechanics, the consequences of subversion, and the benefits of breaking rulesÂ 


The question of ``when is process empathy applicable?" is answered by ``when bureaucracy is present" which requires a definition of bureaucracy. Not limited to gov/commercial/non-profit

What causes bureaucracy? Shared resources and policy-making
