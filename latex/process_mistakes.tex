\section{Process Mistakes\label{sec:process-mistakes}}

Any process involving humans incurs mistakes  
\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy\%27s_law}{Muphy's law}}. 
The purpose of pondering bureaucratic mistakes is to come up with limitations on the ability of mistakes to cause damage. 

\subsection*{Why fixes are Difficult}
Imposing checks meant to reduce mistakes creates more bureaucracy. Oversight roles carry prestige in an organization, so checks intended to limit mistakes propagate up the chain of command.


\subsection*{Why fixes Fail}
The path of information from the person with a problem to the person who can address the situation may pass through many people. 

The consequence is familiar to people who have played the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers\%23Game}{game of telephone}.

\begin{mdframed}
The person with problem explains the problem to the helpdesk staff member. The helpdesk staff member hears the problem with incomplete context and from their own frame, then relays it to their manager, who talks to the manager of the engineering team, who delegates the responsibility to the engineer. 
\end{mdframed}
This is a solvable problem: the engineer could talk with the customer.

At each hand-off there is a significant chance the information is unintentionally mangled. 

\subsection*{Where Process Mistakes come from}
Mistakes in a process can originate from the bureaucrat who inflicts the process, in the hand off between participants, or from the \gls{subject} of the bureaucratic process. Typically there are more checks on subjects and fewer on bureaucrats. 

\subsection*{Choices about Mistakes}
As a process participant, I may cause a mistake or observe a mistake. My options are to can ignore it, fix it (which incurs extra work), or report it. If I chose to report it, I can do so anonymously (which decreases the risk of harm to my reputation, but also eliminates feedback) or with my name so that discussion can occur and I get feedback.
