``Three important characteristics of the informal structure were observed in the study: \\
(a) it arises spontaneously; \\
(b) the bases of the relationships are personal, involving factors of prestige, acceptance within the group, friendship ties, etc.; and \\
(c) the relationships are power relationships, oriented toward techniques of control.''\\
``three functions of informal structures as they operate in formal organizations:\\
(a) as a means of communication, establishing norms of conduct between superordinates and subordinates; \\
(b) "maintenance of cohesiveness in formal organizations through regulating the willingness to serve and the stability of objective authority"; \\
(c) "the maintenance of the feeling of personal integrity, of self-respect, of independent choice."\\

volume={16},
pages={1--24},
year={2006},
journal={Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory},
url={https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/mui027},
NOT_A_KEY={This article questions the fashionable ideas that bureaucratic organization is an obsolescent, undesirable, and non-viable form of administration and that there is an inevitable and irreversible paradigmatic shift towards market- or network-organization. In contrast, the paper argues that contemporary democracies are involved in another round in a perennial debate and ideological struggle over what are desirable forms of administration and government: that is, a struggle over institutional identities and institutional balances. The argument is not that bureaucratic organization is a panacea and the answer to all challenges of public administration. Rather, bureaucratic organization is part of a repertoire of overlapping, supplementary, and competing forms coexisting in contemporary democracies, and so are market-organization and network-organization. Rediscovering Weber's analysis of bureaucratic organization, then, enriches our understanding of public administration. This is in particular true when we (a) include bureaucracy as an institution, not only an instrument; (b) look at the empirical studies in their time and context, not only at Weber's ideal-types and predictions; and (c) take into account the political and normative order bureaucracy is part of, not only the internal characteristics of “the bureau."}

As a rational and efficient form of organization and management system, modern bureaucracy embodies the characteristics of impersonalization and institutionalization that meets the needs of industrial production and organization management. However, in the post-industrial society, the disadvantages of modern bureaucracy are becoming increasingly prominent. There is a fierce conflict between value rationality and instrumental rationality, which caused ethical dilemmas. The key to solve the ethical dilemmas of modern bureaucracy lies in dealing with the relationship between value rationality and instrumental rationality. It’s important to promote the institutionalization of public administration ethics, strengthen the sense of moral responsibility and administrative personality of public administrators.},
