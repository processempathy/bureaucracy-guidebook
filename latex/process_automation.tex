For a workplaces that deal with intangibles the sequential process of evolving towards of process automation are well-trodden.  (When physical objects are involved, then robotics is necessary for automation.)



For an individual, the process is something like
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Transition verbal folklore to written documentation of existing processes.
    \item Transition from plain text documentation to structured data like decision trees, workflow diagrams. Graphviz or Powerpoint
    \item Collect metrics (number of times application was opened, time spent in tool) for existing manual processes to enable cost evaluation for implementing automation. \footnote{see \href{https://xkcd.com/1205/}{https://xkcd.com/1205/} and \href{https://xkcd.com/1319/}{https://xkcd.com/1319/}}

    \item Implement stand-alone scripts per task using personal automation tools like https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ or https://www.autoitscript.com/site/
    \item Tie the scripts to the task workflows from step 2.
    \item automation assistant that actively monitors your activities (keystrokes, mouse clicks, on-screen events) to detect repetitive actions that are candidates for automation.
\end{enumerate}

Gaining the skills to identify opportunities to automate depends on practical skill and experience


At the organizational level, there are are system-level changes like
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hire people who have the mindset of automation and skill to implement automation
    \item Use tracking bits in PDFs and webpages to collect data on how systems are used
    \item Provide a metrics aggregation service
    \item Align incentives (e.g., pay, promotion) with implementation of automation
    \item Transition from paper to PDF to website to API. To read about how this worked out at Amazon see \footnote{\href{https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611}{https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611}}

    \item Every person should be trained to develop software, share code, use APIs, create APIs, maintain APIs.
\end{itemize}
