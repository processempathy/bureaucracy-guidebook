%How does an individual create and accumulate political capital? What does political capital mean with respect to teams?

This section is about actions you can take to create a reputation. Even if you don't intentionally build a reputation you still get one. Also in this section: how to spend political capital -- both your own and that of your team. 

\subsection*{Relevance of Reputation in a Bureaucracy}

As a bureaucrat you may want to be all things to all people. Since that is not feasible, you have to limit your scope and therefore disappoint some people. This same dynamic of a limited scope applies to the team you are on, and again to the organization the team is part of. The purpose of a bureaucratic team or bureaucratic organization is to manage a shared resource for a constituency. The constituency will invariably be disappointed. 

The good news is that you have influence over how others perceive your limitations. Investing in relationships and conducting creative negotiation with other bureaucrats, other teams, and other organizations shape their perception of your value. 

\subsection*{Definition of Reputation}

Your \gls{reputation} as a bureaucrat is what other people expect from you.
\marginpar{[Tag] Definition}
\index{reputation}
Reputation is perception. What does that person think of you? Your team? Your organization? 
Reputation is set whenever and where ever you are observed, or artifacts are associated with you. 
What you wear matters to how you are perceived. When you show up impacts your reputation. How your written communication is read alters perceptions. People are informed by your body posture in meetings. 

\subsection*{Reputation, Brand, Image}

There are multiple phrases that all refer to the same concept of being perceived and the associated expectations. Individuals create (or get) a reputation; organizations have brands. A team of bureaucrats can have a reputation. 

\subsection*{Your Reputation matters}

Your personal reputation within the organization dramatically impacts your effectiveness. People will let you do things (or prevent you from doing things) based on their expectations about you. 

Your reputation matters impacts your influence. Whether other people turn to you for input depends on what they expect from you. How other people perceive you impacts what you can accomplish and when people seek out your help or input.

\subsection*{You can Manage your Reputation}

Managing reputation means acknowledging that your interaction with others is partially performative. This may feel disappointing if you want to be judged solely on your productivity or knowledge. 

Your success is limited if you focus exclusively on doing the work, and your success is limited if you focus exclusively on the performative aspects. 
Neglecting to manage your reputation means you lose input to the stories others tell about you. Active management of your reputation requires engaging people and generating evidence. 

Your reputation is dynamically changing based on your activities and communication. Your communication matters, and the stories other people tell about you matter.

\subsection*{Techniques for Building Reputational Capital}

Ideally your reputation would be based on your technical skills, your ability to collaborate with other people, the strength of your network, and your creativity. None of those matters if the person you're engaging with doesn't know those things. 
You build reputation by doing things that are useful and visible to other people. This positive association is what you are creating.

Because the definition of reputation is about expectations other people have about you, what you choose to work on matters. How you work on your tasks (creativity, enthusiasm, dedication), the artifacts produced, and your ability to communicate all shape your reputation. 

When building reputation, you can work on multiple small wins or take larger risk on bigger bets. The bigger bets provide faster leverage of reputational capital as you have demonstrated your worthiness and skill. 

The same concepts apply to teams of bureaucrats and bureaucratic organizations. Just as individuals compete for resources, teams compete for budget, staffing, and glory. How the team's budget and staffing are spent impact reputation. 

A specific technique for building a good reputation is to give 
\hyperref[sec:credit-others]{credit to others}. 
%(section~\ref{sec:credit-others}).
\marginpar{[Tag] Actionable Advice}
\index{actionable advice}
This may seem counter-intuitive if you are focused on the apparent assignment of credit. What actually matters is that other people observe you (whether directly or indirectly) giving credit. 

Similarly, another technique for building good reputation is offering to \hyperref[sec:take-blame]{take blame}.
%(section~\ref{sec:take-blame}).
\marginpar{[Tag] Actionable Advice}
\index{actionable advice}
Again, this can seem counter-intuitive since being blamed doesn't sound good. The value is in proclaiming your willingness to be blamed such that other people observe your offer. 

\subsection*{Using Good News (or Early News) to build Influence}

Rather than tell good news directly to a top-level decision maker, first inform the person who influences the decision maker.
\marginpar{[Tag] Actionable Advice}
\index{actionable advice}
I tell the influencer the information does not need to be credited to me.

The benefits of this approach include
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improves the influencer's reputation with the decision maker.
    \item The influencer has the chance to contextualize the information for the decision maker.
    \item The influencer has the option to leverage the information in ways I would not have.
    \item My reputation with the influencer is enhanced.
    \item I reaffirmed the influencer's role and status.
    \item Influencers are easier to access.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How to Spend Reputation}

Based on your reputation (what the other person expects), what trust does that person have?  You can then use that trust to do things that might not otherwise be feasible. You can spend reputation to bend the rules. 

Reputation is not the only thing you as a bureaucrat can spend. Other examples include your time (up to you entire career), your ability to be a member in the team or organization, your self-respect, and your ability to be promoted or receive bonuses. At the level of the team and the organization, additional aspects to spend are the budget and the staff. Each of these (reputation, time, membership, budget, staffing) are potential investments. 
%Confusingly, the investments are not independent. 

Things I'm not willing to spend: my integrity and my health (physical, mental, emotional).


Whenever you are engaging within your team, you are either actively spending or building your reputation within the team.
Whenever you are engaging with people from outside your team, you are either actively spending or building your team's reputation.
Because of that, spending reputation means taking risk that involve other people.

\ \\

Examples of spending reputation and not getting a return on the investment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ask for a favors and provide no value.
    \item Explorer options that other people don't see as worthwhile and then there's no payoff.
    \item Produce nothing of value to the organization or other people.
    \item Talk with people outside your team and misrepresent the efforts of your team.
    \item Speaking honestly about the faults of your own team to people outside your team.
\end{itemize}
