is part of the explanation for patterns observed when people interact. A separate explanatory aspect is how tasks get distributed among members of an organization. These two aspects of participating in an organization are often confounded. This appendix describes a model of processes and tasks that involve coordination. The purpose of the model in this appendix is to distinguish aspects of an organization that are not attributable to bureaucracy. 
%The model is useful for distinguishing the effects of bureaucracy (distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making) from the distribution of tasks in an organization.

The model of task distribution in an organization is sufficiently detailed to illustrate commonly observed situations but is agnostic to the specific tasks or work roles. Improvements to the model intended to increase the realism could be made, but risk decreasing the clarity of the model.

The model relies on a few concepts. These definitions are local to the model and do not apply to the rest of the book:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Specialization} refers to categories of ability. A person has a specialization. Completing a task requires a specialization. Examples of specialization include lifting boxes from the ground onto a shelf, writing a report summarizing an experiment, providing customer support, or creating a contract for a service. 
    \item \textbf{Skill-level} is a ranking of proficiency for how work can be done for a task. If a task requires a skill-level higher than a person has, then that person is unable to complete the task. Examples of skill-levels include the ability to lift small boxes versus large boxes, a poorly written report versus a well-written report, mediocre customer support versus amazing customer support, and an acceptable contract versus a robust contract.
    \item \textbf{Person}: a member of the organization, has specializations, has a skill-level per specialization, can receive tasks, and can engage with other people in the organization. In this model a person can complete one task at a time. A person can coordinate one task at a time. A person has the following attributes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Person's \textbf{contact list}: A person has a list of people they've previously given tasks to. When figuring out who to give a task to, they can review the list of people they already know. 
        \item Person's \textbf{backlog}: Each person maintains a queue of tasks to be done.
        \item Person's \textbf{status}: A person is either idle (not assigned a task), working on a task, or coordinating with other people. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Organization}: a set of people who can be assigned tasks to work on. 
    \item \textbf{Task}: requires one specialization, has an associated minimum skill-level, and has an amount of time that the task takes. A task can only be worked on by one person at a time. 
    \item \textbf{Process}: comprised of one or more tasks.\footnote{See Wikipedia entry on 
    \index{Wikipedia!Queueing Theory@\string\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory}{Queueing Theory}}
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory}{Queueing Theory}.} Tasks in a process are worked on sequentially by people. At any given time the process is owned by one person who is either coordinating or working on the task. Processes are independent from other processes.
    \item \textbf{Coordination} is the effort to find a person with the relevant specialization and skill-level for a task. 
\end{itemize}

In the model I'm using the word task instead of work. In Physics the concept of work applies when there is a product that is tangible and countable. Making tacos takes work; whereas approving requests is a distinct concept because there is nothing tangible. For knowledge workers, which most bureaucrats are, the unit of tasking is more applicable. Instead of tangible work, tasks are relevant when \gls{attention-time} is spent on an issue.
Each participant in the organization has the same amount of attention-time to spend, but different specializations and skill-levels per specialization.

%The model is abstract so that is applicable to many contexts. 
%A simple process is a sequence of few tasks, and each task does not require significant specialization or skill-level.
%A complex process is a sequence of many tasks, and each task requires specialized skills, and the number of distinct specializations is high.

When a person is assigned a task they don't have the specialization for or lack enough skill-level in that specialization, then they have to find someone else in the organization who is capable of doing the task. 
In the model of tasks the random selection of someone else who has the necessary specialization and skill-level is insensitive to the size of their backlog. This reflects my experience in organizations where task backlogs are not visible. As a consequence, you merely add something to their backlog and hope they will get to it eventually.



The model relies on a process being a sequence of tasks. That might not be realistic when branching is part of a process (conditional branching or splitting).
Real processes feature branching in two senses. The first sense of branching is the conditional logic: ``if this else that.''
The second sense of branching is that a task is the initiation point of another process. 
In either of those two senses of branching the processes can be treated as independent sequences of tasks.



The following lists simplifying assumptions -- what isn't in this numerical model of tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is nothing in the model about policies, decision-making~\cite{2009_Klimek}, shared resources, or subjects of bureaucracy. This model is included in a book about bureaucracy to show that not all patterns observed in an organization should be blamed on bureaucracy. 
    \item There's no hierarchy in the model. The model assumes people are cooperating in the organization. Unlike the rest of the book, this model does not use the distinction of organizations being comprised of teams.
    \item People in the model don't get to initiate tasks of their own volition. They work on tasks that are either from their personal backlog or from an infinite set of tasks.
    \item People in the model don't get to refuse any task that is assigned to them for which they have the specialization and relevant skill-level.
    \item No overtime. Every person gets the same amount of time to do work.
    \item No support staff. No delegation. 
    \item No prioritization of tasks in the backlog. Tasks in the backlog are completed in the order in which they were added. 
    \item Infrastructure needed for communication works without failure. Infrastructure needed for completion of a task works without failure. 
    \item No dark patterns. Everyone does the task assigned promptly and correctly.
    \item No turnover of staff during the simulation. See \iftoggle{haspagenumbers}{page~\pageref{sec:new-person}}{section~\ref{sec:new-person}} for an accounting of new people in a process.
    \item No improvement of skill-level per person and no expansion of specializations. No training or learning happens. (Learning takes time and has a near-term decrease in throughput but sometimes has long-term benefit to the organization.)
\end{itemize}
The complexities above are not included in the model because the point of the model is to show what arises from simple constraints. 

Within the constraints, improvements could be made to the model. 
However,  conclusions drawn from the model map to real-world organizations even without these features: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use realistic distributions (e.g., power law) instead of uniform distributions for parameters like skill-level, specialization, and task duration.
    \item When a person is not qualified to do a task, instead of searching randomly, search second-order contacts. The current (unrealistic) implementation is that a person sends their request for help to random members of the organization.
\end{itemize}
Adding nuance for realism would increase the complexity of the model but is not expected to alter the conclusions.

\section{Examples of Tasks and People}

Suppose the model is configured to simulate three specializations (A, B, C) and three skill-levels (1, 2, 3). 

\subsection*{Example People\label{sec:example-people}}

A person with skill-level 3 in specialization A and skill-level 1 in specialization C is labeled ``A3,C1''. A visualization of their capabilities is the following table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
&\multicolumn{3}{c}{\footnotesize Specializations}\\
\hline
& A & B & C \\
\hline
1 & X & & X \\
\hline
2 & X & & \\
\hline
3 & X & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Because this person has skill-level three in specialization A, that means they can also work on tasks that require skill-level two or skill-level one.

People can be characterized by the depth and breadth of their skills. For example, a ``expert specialist'' (e.g.,~``B3") is good at one thing, 
\begin{center}
Expert:
$\left\{
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
&\multicolumn{3}{c}{\footnotesize Specializations}\\
%\hline
& A & B & C \\
\cline{2-4}
1 & &  X &  \\
\cline{2-4}
2 & & X & \\
\cline{2-4}
3 & & X & \\
\cline{2-4}
\end{tabular}
\right.$
%\qquad
\end{center}
while a ``general specialist" (e.g.,~``A1,B3,C1") has \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills}{T-shaped skills}:
\begin{center}
Generalist Expert:
$\left\{
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
& \multicolumn{3}{c}{\footnotesize Specializations}\\
%\hline
& A & B & C \\
\cline{2-4}
1 & X &  X & X \\
\cline{2-4}
2 & & X & \\
\cline{2-4}
3 & & X & \\
\cline{2-4}
\end{tabular}
\right.$
\end{center}

A generalist (here~``A1,B1,C1") is not an expert at anything but is capable in multiple specializations. 
\begin{center}
Generalist:
$\left\{
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
 & \multicolumn{3}{c}{\footnotesize Specializations}\\
%\hline
& A & B & C \\
\cline{2-4}
1 & X &  X & X \\
\cline{2-4}
 2 & &  & \\
\cline{2-4}
3 &  &  & \\
\cline{2-4}
\end{tabular}
\right.$
%\qquad
\end{center}

A unicorn (here~``A3,B3,C3") can do everything well.
\begin{center}
Unicorn:
$\left\{
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
& \multicolumn{3}{c}{\footnotesize Specializations}\\
%\hline
   & A & B & C \\
\cline{2-4}
 1 & X & X & X \\
\cline{2-4}
 2 & X & X & X \\
\cline{2-4}
 3 & X & X & X \\
\cline{2-4}
\end{tabular}
\right.$
\end{center}


There are many more unskilled specialists (e.g.,~``A1'') than unicorns.
\begin{center}
Unskilled Specialist:
$\left\{
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
& \multicolumn{3}{c}{\footnotesize Specializations}\\
%\hline
   & A & B & C \\
\cline{2-4}
 1 & X &   &  \\
\cline{2-4}
 2 &   &   & \\
\cline{2-4}
 3 &   &   & \\
\cline{2-4}
\end{tabular}
\right.$
\end{center}

\subsection*{Tasks and Processes}

A task that requires skill-level 2 in specialization B is labeled ``B2.''
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
%\multicolumn{3}{c}{\footnotesize Specializations}\\
%\hline
%A & B & C \\
%\hline
% &   &  \\
%\hline
% & X & \\
%\hline
% & & \\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}
The assumption that a task requires one specialization is based on the idea that a process can be broken into a sequence of atomic tasks, and that one person can do an atomic task. 

A process is a sequence of tasks. For example, the list ``B2:10, A1:5, C3:7" describes three tasks: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Task requiring specialization B and skill-level 2; duration of 10 minutes.
    \item Task requiring specialization A and skill-level 1; duration of 5 minutes.
    \item Task requiring specialization C and skill-level 3; duration of 7 minutes.    
\end{enumerate}

In this model tasks can be done by more skilled people faster. If a task requires skill-level 2 and takes 10 minutes, then
\begin{itemize}
    \item A person with skill-level 2 completes the task in 10 minutes.
    \item A person with skill-level 3 completes the task in  7 minutes (=10/(3/2)).
    \item A person with skill-level 1 is unable to complete the task.
\end{itemize}

\iftoggle{shortsectiontitle}{\sectionmark{Configurations of the Model}}{}

% square-braces shows up in the TOC
% curly-braces is the section title


Comparing different configurations of the model requires a metric. 
Task throughput (number of tasks completed per unit time) is a way to characterize the productivity of an organization. 


\subsection*{Scenario: Everyone is an A1}

Suppose every person in the organization is an A1 and every task is an A1.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|}
%\cline{2}
  & A \\
\cline{2-2}
1 & X \\
\cline{2-2}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As a consequence of this configuration, no coordination is required because each person can do every task. Observations about this configuration include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of people each person knows is irrelevant because coordination is unnecessary.
    \item This configuration yields the maximum throughput tasks for the organization.
    \item Adding more people increases the throughput.
\end{itemize}

These same conclusions hold for any configuration of an organization comprised exclusively of unicorns. 
The concept of every member being able to do any task is the approach advocated by 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy}{Adhocracy}.%
\index{Wikipedia!adhocracy@\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy}{adhocracy}}
The feasibility of gathering people with relevant talents becomes challenging as the task complexity increases or increased throughput is needed. That is why organizations hire people who are not unicorns. 



%\subsection*{Scenario: A1,B1 or A1,B0 or A0,B1 or A0,B0\\with (task duration = coordination duration)\\with no social circle}
\subsection*{Scenario: A1,B1 or A1,B0 or A0,B1 or A0,B0}

The simplest non-trivial scenario occurs when not every member of an organization can do every task. For example, suppose  there are two specializations (A, B) and one skill level: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}
%\cline{2-3}
  & A & B \\
\cline{2-3}
1 & X &   \\
\cline{2-3}
\end{tabular} \quad
%\quad and \quad
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}
%\cline{2-3}
  & A & B \\
\cline{2-3}
1 &   & X \\
\cline{2-3}
\end{tabular} \quad
%\quad and \quad
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}
%\cline{2-3}
  & A & B \\
\cline{2-3}
1 & X & X \\
\cline{2-3}
\end{tabular} \quad
%\quad and \quad
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}
%\cline{2-3}
  & A & B \\
\cline{2-3}
1 &   &   \\
\cline{2-3}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
In this configuration, the person qualified as A1,B1 is labeled a unicorn -- they can do any task. Whether you consider inclusion of A0,B0 (a person who does no work and can only coordinate) to be relevant depends on your personal experience. Most organizations label these members as ``managers.'' 

When a person does not have all the specializations, then a task randomly assigned to one person may need to be given to someone else in the organization. For example, a person qualified as A1 and given a B1 task, that person needs to find a coworker who is either qualified as B1 or A1,B1. Distributing tasks among members of the organization requires coordination.

Person 4 does not appear in this figure because they completed no tasks.}
\label{fig:task-distribution-percent-of-tasks}
\end{figure}



%a metric of interest is the number of task per simulated tick as a function of the number of people present in the organization.



The need for coordination can be blamed on the random delegation of tasks not being aligned to the specializations and skill-levels of the workers. 
The distribution of skills and specializations of people in an organization is set by the hiring process. Hiring less qualified people is easier than finding highly skills people. 
%But that only applies if the tasks are atomic and independent.

%If tasks are part of a process, and a person owns the process, and task in a process cannot be handled by one person, then coordination re-emerges as a requirement.


\begin{samepage}
Conclusions from this configuration of the model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The reward for good work is more work. People with more specializations and more skills do more work than their coworkers.
    \item Time spent coordinating results in lower throughput of tasks.
\end{itemize}
\end{samepage}

The last question for this configuration is how the throughput scales as the number of people in the organization is increased.
The overhead of coordination among less-skilled people means that doubling the number of participants does not double the task throughput. This observation was made by

\caption{Task throughput after 100 ticks versus number of people in the organization. 25 simulations were run for each organization size. 
Adding people does increase throughput, but the variance of throughput increases due to dependence on the distribution of specializations and skill-levels of the participants. The instances where task completion is near zero occur when no members of the organization have enough skills to address tasks. That condition is less likely as the number of people increases.
%This configuration of the model has no social circle and the task duration is the same as the coordination duration.
}
\label{fig:task-distribution-completed-vs-size}
\end{figure}


When people in an organization are not unicorns (there are some tasks a person is unable to do), then the task throughput is lower. If an organization comprised of unicorns would operate faster, why distribute work to people who lack the skills and rely on coordination?
Because the specialization of skills is too diverse for any one person to master everything. This is easy to understand when the organization is society. It would be faster for you to 
 inspect the meat you eat for food safety, monitor the emissions of the coal-fired power plant that powers your house, build the semiconductor chips you use, and manufacture the airplane you fly. However, you don't have all those skills and you want the results quicker than you can complete the tasks yourself. Therefore, the tasks are distributed among an organization of people with different skills. The cost of coordination is that the throughput is lower.



%\subsection*{Scenario: A1,B1 or A1,B0 or A0,B1 or A0,B0\\with (task duration = coordination duration)\\with social circle}

%When a person is assigned a task they are unable to do, they spend time searching for a coworker capable of doing the task.
%The amount of time a person spends searching the organization depends on who else that person already knows. 

%If I'm qualified as ``A1" and the task is ``B1," then I can give the task to a coworker who I know is qualified as ``B1." If I don't know anyone with the relevant specialization and skill-level, then I have to search the rest of the organization.
%The more people I know the less time I spend searching.

%A person who is an A1,B1 will have no contact list because there is no handoff needed. A person who is A0,B0 will have a randomly populated contact list. A person who is A1,B0 will have a contact list populated with people who have B1.

%With this feature in the model, we can look for a tipping point when the organization is larger than the size of each member's social circle. We expect a change in throughput when the organization exceeds \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar\%27s_number}{Dunbar's number}.

%\section{to investigate}

%The minimum throughput is no unicorns. What is the spread?

%Does the system reach steady state? 
%Or do task backlogs grow unbounded?

%What is the relevance of unicorns who can do every task well for throughput or minimum task completion time?
%(Characterization) What is the density of unicorns?




%The search time when the organization is smaller than a socialist goal is negligible, whereas when the organization is larger than their social circle the search time increases proportional to the number of people never organization. This is an obvious statement, but it indicates why larger organizations feel different than a small group of people working together who know each other.
%Hierarchy is not included in this numerical model, but it is one way of addressing this? Of how to coordinate outside of your social circle.


\section{Selection of Tasks is Complicated}

An assumption in the model is that each person has a backlog of tasks they work on sequentially. If that assumption is violated and the person gets to choose their next task then negotiation and 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making}{decision-making}
\index{Wikipedia!decision-making@\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making}{decision-making}}
are invoked. The outcome of a task may be unclear (great results, mediocre results, or a dead-end), and the benefits of completing a task may be informed by relationships with team members. A person in an organization is informally bartering for attention of other members they rely on. Prioritizing the backlog of tasks involves an implicit quid pro quo with other people. 

Having a backlog of task and not being constrained to serial completion opens another question. Should you take a breadth-first approach (do a little exploration of each) or a depth-first approach (exhaust one option at time before moving on to another)? The answer depends on a few factors, like whether task switching is beneficial (e.g., break in the monotony, or waiting for something else) or detrimental (e.g., increased cognitive load, or decay of pershible result). 

\section{What to Do about Too Many Tasks}

% source: https://graphthinking.blogspot.com/2023/02/prioritization-of-tasks.html

Because unicorns can do any task, one way to improve throughput is to invest in training people. Training in the context of this model has the purpose of  increased breadth (added specializations) or increased depth (improved skill-level for a specialization). One reason there are not more unicorns in an organization is that not everyone wants to know and do everything. Knowing how to create a webpage, analyze data, manage a server, initiate a contract, interact with customers, gather requirements, and run a team can feel overwhelming. Another reason unicorns are rare is turnover. When a person outgrows their assigned role,  they may look to other opportunities to feel more fulfilled. Retaining unicorns is challenging.

A separate approach to having too many tasks relative to the number of people in the workforce is to prioritize the work. Prioritization doesn't necessarily increase task throughput, but without prioritization, tasks get started and may not get completed. (The problem of ``start a task but don't finish it" isn't part of the numerical model but does happen in real organizations.)

Prioritization requires sacrifice (what tasks are you not doing) and induces risk (there are consequences to not doing tasks) and spends your reputation (not doing tasks affects other people).

There are two conditions under which prioritization becomes important:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of tasks is less than or equal to the amount of staff attention available and skill. Then prioritization is merely ordering the sequence of tasks.
    \item When the number of tasks exceeds staffing capacity and skill-level per person, an oversubscribed person won't get to every task. Saying no is important but harms your reputation.
\end{itemize}


Prioritization strategies options
\begin{itemize}
    \item Don't prioritize. Work on tasks as they are identified and don't complete anything because it gets interrupted by the next task
Static prioritization that is exclusive. Only work on one thing to the exclusion of everything else.
    \item Shifting prioritization (prioritization changes over time); either:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prioritization evolves slower than tasks can be completed.
        \item Prioritization shifts faster than tasks can be completed is ineffective because it is indistinguishable from responding to tasks as they arise.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Static prioritization by category. Likely to harm your reputation with people come to you with tasks that aren't in your primary category.
    \item Prioritization within proportionally allocated task categories. For example, suppose you have three categories of tasks. You allocate 10\% of your time to the first category, 20\% of your time to the second, and your remaining time to  the third category. 
\end{itemize}
