\section{Each Phase of Life involves Bureaucracy}
In each person's life there are standard milestones: birth, education, work, death. 
The relationships in each phase are distinct.
Each of these milestones and phases involves bureaucracy. Each phase is a different experience of bureaucracy because the bureaucratic roles change.

Bureaucracy is composed of three roles: the policy creator, the policy enforcer, and the subject (upon whom the policy is inflicted). 
\index{bureaucracy!roles}
These roles can be confounded by the label ``bureaucrat" because who is the bureaucrat and who is the subject depends on the relationship in a scenario. 

For example, a store manager creates a policy, a store clerk enforces the policy, and the policy is inflicted on the customer. Both the manager and the store clerk would be bureaucrats, while the customer is the subject. In a separate example, someone at corporate headquarters sets a policy, the store manager enforces it, and the policy is inflicted on the store clerk. Then the clerk was the subject. 


\subsection*{Bureaucracy of Birth\label{sec:bureacracy-of-birth}}
Your birth was marked by getting a name, registering with the state, and initiating medical records. These tasks were administered by bureaucrats (doctors and nurses and other hospital staff) on your behalf. The bureaucrats included the hospital staff, and you were the subject of the bureaucracy. You had no autonomy or decision making authority. 

\subsection*{Bureaucracy in Early Childhood\label{sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood}}
Before starting education, the bureaucracy of early childhood is inflicted primarily by family members setting and carrying out policies. The organization of bureaucrats is the family. Other community members or caretakers may also be involved to carry out the polices of taking care of you. Your decision making authority was extremely limited. 

\subsection*{Bureaucrats at School\label{sec:bureaucracy-of-school}}
Once you started the education process, new bureaucrats got involved.  The community of bureaucrats could be a public school, a private school, or homeschooling. In any of those cases, the frontline bureaucrat is the teacher. You don't have responsibility for making policy that other people follow; you are still the subject of bureaucracy.


The expectations of each phase of school (high school, undergraduate, graduate school) are distinct, and they are different from working in a large organization. Your autonomy increases throughout the duration of school. %, and your ability to make policy that effects others grows. 
Your family and teachers are the bureaucrats. You start building informal organizations of friends, and you start to explore policies around social bonding.

Schooling sets a pattern that most students will fall into for the rest of their lives. You were handed a textbook and told to solve a set of problems. You have the autonomy to do more than what is required. You can find other textbooks that match your interests or are written from a different view. 

You get to choose the book you want, even if you don't get to choose the topic you are going to be evaluated on. You don't even need to pick just one reference book -- you can pick lots of books and figure out which author style best fits you. You can also choose the level of difficulty -- very basic and beginner level, or more advanced (depending on where you are, rather than where a class in school is supposed to be).

You can discover how you learn best. This extra effort requires self-reflection: How did you learn? What worked best? What didn't work, and why not? What did you learn? What do you wish you had learned?

Another pattern that schooling relies on is single choice decisions where there is only one right answer. Examples include math problems and multiple choice tests. Schooling tends to avoid setting up dilemmas or paradoxes for students. Academic problems in the education process are designed to be independent of the people involved or the history of the situation.

% did not prepare me for addressing challenges at work. 
In my schooling I learned how to approach technical issues and develop solutions. That problem-solution paradigm neglects crucial steps of discovering the problem, isolating the challenge, identifying stakeholders, learning the history of the challenge, and negotiating with stakeholders before trying to address the challenge. 

My schooling led me to emphasize academics over socializing. When I transitioned to professional work, I realized that social skills and political savvy useful when trying to change organizations and policies. 

Unlike academic problems that rely on and evaluate my answers, working in a bureaucratic organization the challenges are ill-defined, there's no known solution, and the problem is sufficiently complex that I have to collaborate.

\subsection*{Military Service Bureaucracy\label{bureaucracy-of-military}}
Less than 0.5\% of the United States population serves in the military\footnote{source: \href{https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military}{Council on Foreign Relations}}. For those who do serve, the military's rigid hierarchy and defined protocols is a distinct experience compared to school or work. The transition from military to civilian life can present a dissonance for service members used to the chain of command and clearly defined orders. 

\subsection*{Working in a Bureaucratic Organization\label{sec:bureaucracy-of-work}}
Within the employment phase, there are pairs start and end events which may apply: hiring or getting hired; firing, getting fired, or quitting. 

Employment: managers above you, peer employees, people you manage are all members of an organization. 


You encounter shared resources at work: bathrooms, conference rooms, kitchen areas with fridges and microwaves, storage areas. 

Bathroom example: the bathroom smells sometimes so I'm a nice person and I bring a scented air freshener. Unbeknownst to me, that triggers an asthma or allergic reaction for my coworkers. Now a policy gets created so this mistake doesn't happen again. Signs are posted. 


\subsection*{Healthcare and Death\label{sec:bureaucracy-of-death}}
Doctors and nurses and other staff are bureaucrats; you are the subject; the hospital or clinic is the organization. 


\subsubsection*{Toilet paper at the hospital}

TODO: Perspective of the person seeking to use toilet paper, Perspective of the janitor, Perspective of the purchasing manager 

\marginpar{[Tag] Story Time}
\index{story time!toilet paper at hospital}
\begin{mdframed}
If you go to a hospital, use the bathroom, and find there is no toilet paper, that would indicate a deficiency.
Someone didn't refill the toilet paper. Since the person who normally refills toilet paper wasn't also a user, they aren't directly affected by the lack of toilet paper.
So someone needs to have a routine of checking bathrooms for toilet paper availability. Money spent checking to toilet paper is money not spent on the primary mission of the hospital.
Minimizing checking is important, so a feedback mechanism is instituted -- a phone number to text regarding bathroom status at the hospital.
\end{mdframed}

% TODO: transition
Death can invoke both the medical system and the government.

All of these roles and relationship involve subjectively administered policies within an organization. The point of recognizing the role of bureaucrats is to help you identify what is negotiable.
