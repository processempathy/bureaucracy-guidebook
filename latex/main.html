<p>Bureaucracy is a consistent and pervasive challenge in modern
society. You have direct experience with bureaucracy and may be familiar
with complaints about bureaucracy. You probably don't consider yourself
a bureaucrat and are probably not an expert on bureaucracy.</p>
<p>This book is intended to alter your view of bureaucracy. This book
starts with an unconventional definition and then uses the definition to
explain the necessity of various aspects of bureaucracy. Having
identified specific challenges, the book serves as a guide for how you
can be effective.</p>
<p>A guide for situations you haven't been in before can decrease your
anxiety by making the unfamiliar less intimidating. A guide labels
patterns and provides context for your observations. Recognizing a
familiar challenge can be preferable to the uncertainty of facing a
novel scenario. An unfamiliar situation means not knowing how to start
and not knowing the potential paths to success. In contrast, a challenge
you understand can feel less burdensome. Even if you have not faced the
particular challenge before, a guide can make that new challenge seem
familiar and manageable. Having a guide doesn't make your life easy --
even a challenge that is understood requires creativity and effort.</p>
<p>Having a guide isn't helpful if you find the topic repulsive.
Negative impressions of bureaucracy are common. The word evokes
reactions of disgust, primarily driven by how individuals have
experienced bureaucracy. The results of bureaucracy can appear idiotic --
wasting time and resources or causing harm to people.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Bureaucracy is even regarded as dangerous to society.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I
have bad news for you if you have a negative impression of bureaucracy:
bureaucracy is vital to society.</p>
<p>Having a precise definition of bureaucracy enables a more nuanced
discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Bureaucracy is the set of subjective
decisions made by individual participants in an organization responsible
for a shared resource. Because no one member knows everything and no one
person decides everything, bureaucracy relies on distributed knowledge
and distributed decision-making. The resources managed by an
organization can be either tangible or in the form of expertise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concepts and techniques in this book are derived from this
definition. For more exploration of this definition, see the section "<a
href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">What is Bureaucracy?</a>"</p>
<p>You can learn to skillfully navigate bureaucracy by using the
techniques in this book. A skilled bureaucrat is more effective. That
improvement enhances the organization you are a member of. Modern
society is an interwoven fabric of organizations, with bureaucracy being
the crucial material. Rather than ponder societal-scale concerns, this
book focuses on the complicated and typical experience of a
bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The framing of how you think about bureaucracy shapes what action you
feel is relevant for changing your environment. Suppose your assumptions
are wrong about how the system of bureaucracy works. Then you will be
trying to convert the system to meet your incorrect expectations and
your actions are likely to be wasted effort tackling irrelevant aspects.
An accurate model of bureaucracy allows you to be more effective and
your changes to the system are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>As an example of how the above definition is distinct from
conventional definitions<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, I view government as an instance of
where bureaucracy occurs. Bureaucracy is not limited to governments. I
use "organization" to encompass governments, corporations, non-profits,
or any collection of people working together. As a consequence, a vast
majority of people are bureaucrats.</p>
<p>The widely-held negative connotation of bureaucracy may lead you to
reject the label of bureaucrat. Your recognition of your status as a
bureaucrat matters even if you intentionally reject the label or do not
recognize that you are a bureaucrat. How you behave and what you think
your responsibilities are depend on how you label yourself. If you don't
think of yourself as a bureaucrat, then you won't be able to distinguish
what is your fault, what is the fault of your coworkers, what is the
fault of management, and what is intrinsic to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Reasoning about bureaucracy is an accessible topic for every reader
because we each have personal experiences. A commonly held view is that
the systems of bureaucracy we work within are broken: participants are
harmed and there is inequality. The counterargument is that the
bureaucratic behavior observed is how the system was designed to work.
There is a third argument: bureaucratic systems work in a degraded mode
-- they are less efficient than what is possible. In this book I set
aside the macro-scale questions of bureaucracy like the three arguments
above and focus on the human-scale interactions that give rise to
bureaucracy. Rather than complain about systemic problems, this book
provides you with practical actions for situations you encounter.</p>
<p>Even people who are smart (e.g., they know history, they have
memorized capital cities, they can do math) can struggle when faced with
complex, large-scale distributed systems comprised of humans. Thinking
about complex, large-scale systems is not part of the conventional
education curriculum. This book will help you learn about bureaucracy,
increase your ability to identify patterns, and apply relevant
techniques. The pervasiveness of bureaucracy means the opportunities to
apply the skills you learn in this book are frequent -- at your job, at
the grocery story, in negotiating with your family.</p>
<p>The difficulties of bureaucracy are central to large societies that
depend on complex interactions of many people. From the delivery of
water and removal of sewage to advanced manufacturing that depends on
long supply chains, bureaucracy is useful. The challenge of bureaucracy
is widespread across various governments and companies in different
societies of all scales. And bureaucracy is durable -- it has existed for
thousands of years. Because bureaucracy is pervasive, tackling the topic
of bureaucracy is exciting and crucial. The excitement comes from the
opportunities available for the many potential improvements. Being an
effective bureaucrat is important because bureaucracy can be a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication">force
multiplier</a> beyond what one person could accomplish on their own.</p>
<p>Everyone is a bureaucrat because there are few alternatives to
bureaucracy for a society constrained by finite resources. Gaining
skills in navigating bureaucracy is helpful both for your happiness and
the improved functioning of society. That may seem abstract and lofty,
but the situation is inescapable: you are a member of society and
benefit from participating in society.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are curious about the complex world we
live in, if you are thinking about how to contribute to society, if you
want impactful employment, or if your job is not what you expected. This
book will to help you understand why and how innovation is suffocated
within bureaucratic organizations. Understanding the challenges means
you can design ideas that are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Every person in society is a participant in bureaucracy. The purpose
of this book is to decrease the surprise of that experience and better
prepare you emotionally and intellectually for the toil of being a
bureaucrat. With focused reflection and a good guide like this book, you
can improve your skills as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The topic of bureaucracy spans academic disciplines - <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">psychology</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology">sociology</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_behavior">organizational

administration</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology">anthropology</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science">political
science</a>. Most bureaucrats have no formal training in any of these
domains. This book is not written from an academic perspective; it is
written by a practicing bureaucrat to serve as a guide to be read by
bureaucrats.</p>
<p>As a result of reading this book, you will be better able to
recognize and navigate complex human interactions, both within your
career and outside of work. Perspectives offered in this book can
benefit you directly, whether by promotion of rank or title, increase in
pay, successful completion of a project, or through decreased stress
derived from an improved understanding of how bureaucracy works. Being a
more effective bureaucrat can also positively impact the causes you care
about and the people you engage with.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-this-book-is-not">What this Book is
Not</h3>
<p>This book is not a defense of bureaucracy, nor is it intended to
disparage bureaucrats or the system of bureaucracy. Instead, this book
is a guide to bureaucracy-as-it-is. There are no hacks presented for
circumventing bureaucracy. Instead, this book provides advice on being
an effective member of a bureaucratic organization.</p>
<p>This book does not focus on leadership, managing a team, being a team
member, planning, time management, project management, advancing your
career, promotions, or self-improvement. In the process of being a
better bureaucrat, some lessons may apply in those domains.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is domain-specific, nothing is tied to the
engineering of products, and nothing is applicable solely to science
research or policy development. However, skills associated with being an
effective bureaucrat do translate into other domains.</p>
<p>This book doesn't address personal stress caused by bureaucracy, how
to decrease stress, or how to balance the activities of work and
life-outside-work. However, understanding bureaucracy can enable a
positive sense of self based on how your efforts integrate with other
people's tasks.</p>
<p>This book does not address work conditions, pay, benefits, or
retirement plans. If you are seeking a competitive advantage that might
result in improved outcomes, learning to navigate bureaucracy helps.</p>
<p>This book doesn't focus on citizens, political policymakers,
oversight (e.g., Congress at the state or federal level, Inspectors
General), competing organizations, contracts, the budget of an
organization, fines and other regulatory punishments resulting from
bureaucracy, policy enforcement, specific policies and regulations,
formal arbitration or judicial resolution of disputes. For observations
on those topics, see Wilson's Bureaucracy&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1991_Wilson">(J. Q. Wilson 1991)</span>.</p>
<p>This book doesn't address discrimination or harassment. I neglect
differences in experience based on race, gender, or socioeconomic
status. This book doesn't address bad coworkers, abusive bosses,
psychological defects of individuals, or malicious intent. I assume no
traitors, spies, or <a
href="https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;did=750070">saboteurs</a>.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I do not address <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">dark patterns</a>;
issues like lying, bribery&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2021_Ang">(Ang 2021)</span>, and criminal behavior are not
discussed. All of those aspects happen whenever people interact; those
challenges are not specific to bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is not a
manifestation of incompetence, malicious actors, or mistakes. Sources of
friction in a well-run bureaucracy stem from perpetual challenges like
ambiguity, finite attention, and inadequate resources.</p>
<p>Focusing on the morals of organizations or bureaucrats<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> is
less compelling than studying bureaucracy because norms (i.e.,
expectations for individuals and organizations) shift over time, while
bureaucracy is persistent. In this book I focus on culturally invariant
aspects of bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
<p>In this book I assume you are honest and that other people are
honest. I assume bureaucrats strive for fairness, though the definition
of fairness may vary from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. Even with all these
simplifying assumptions and unaddressed topics the complexities of
bureaucracy arise. My guidance on how to be an effective bureaucrat is
in the context of benign bureaucracy.</p>
<p>This book is based on personal experience operating in multiple large
organizations and small teams, reading published books and papers, and
insight from fellow bureaucrats. Informal surveys were conducted but are
not foundational for claims made in this book. No <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment">double-blind</a>
experiments were conducted. I have attempted to learn from my mistakes
by reflecting on my (in)actions and the consequences. This ad hoc
approach has been an expensive education. My mistakes delayed progress
and damaged relationships. This book aims to provide generalizations
from my experiences that might benefit the reader. My hope for this
guide is to decrease your surprise when you encounter what would have
been novel situations.</p>

<p>The motivating logic for this book is a sequence of claims:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A community has limited resources that members desire. The
community responds to that constraint by sharing resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Managing access to a <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span> requires
making and enforcing policies that apply to community members.</p></li>
<li><p>When more than one person is responsible for making and enforcing
policies, distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making is
required.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucracy is defined as multiple people managing access to
shared resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether you're a <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> or a subject of
bureaucracy, you can be more effective by applying <a
href="#sec:process-empathy">process empathy</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've familiarized yourself with the concepts in this book,
using what you've learned is a two-step process. First, ask yourself
whether the conditions for bureaucracy are present. If they are, then
you can be more effective by applying process empathy.</p>
<p>The definition of bureaucracy is the basis for evaluating the
scenario you are in. Illustrations of bureaucracy provided throughout
this book demonstrate how you can grow your process empathy.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="process-empathy"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Process Empathy<span
id="sec:process-empathy" label="sec:process-empathy"></span></h2>
<p>Empathy typically refers to understanding the emotions of another
person. To detect the emotional state of another person you rely on
facial expressions (smiles for happiness, frowns for frustration), body
language (arms crossed, turning away), speech (yelling in anger, singing
for joy), and actions (hitting something when angry). You evaluate a
person's emotional state from these signals by recalling instances where
you felt similar emotions. Emotional empathy helps you understand and
relate to the other person.</p>
<p>A distinct form of empathy is the ability to understand the reasoning
another person uses. To distinguish that from emotional empathy, I use a
separate label: <a href="#sec:intellectual-empathy">intellectual
empathy</a>. This names the concept of establishing a common
understanding of an issue (even if you disagree). You can apply
intellectual empathy in both a one-on-one interaction and amongst a team
of people. Intellectual empathy is enacted by thinking about how another
person would assess a situation and how they might respond. Another
technique is to imagine what reasoning they would use when presented
with a set of facts. For example, if you're shopping for food and see
carrots are available, you can try to project how other people you live
with would respond to having carrots in their meals. Would they value
the variety in their diet, or would they wonder why you are punishing
them?</p>
<p>A third form of empathy is the focus of this book: the ability to
perceive why individuals working together behave in recurring patterns.
What incentives do people in each role have, what information does each
person have, and how does that manifest as actions by the team or
organization? Applying the paradigm of <span
data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span> helps you
answer questions like "Why is this taking so long?" and "Why is this
action so apparently inefficient?" even when no one participant is lazy
or inept. The answers come from recognizing <a
href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">unavoidable hazards</a> of bureaucracy.
As another example, the question "Why are people under-trained for their
role?" is resolved by recognizing the consequence of constant <a
href="#sec:turnover">turnover</a>. Process empathy relies on your
understanding of bureaucracy to help you distinguish which patterns are
specific to the people involved versus specific to this organization
versus generic to every organization.</p>
<p>Reasoning about a process is slightly different than process empathy.
Reasoning assumes a holistic external view (taken by Gall in <em>The
Systems Bible</em>,&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2002_Gall">(Gall
2002)</span>), whereas process empathy is about the perspective of
individual people operating within their local context. Reasoning about
teams and the aggregate organization invariably leads to observations of
illogical and absurd outcomes, whereas a view based on process empathy
reveals the causes of apparent paradoxes.</p>
<p>Process empathy is comprised of thinking beyond professional
relationships with individuals and deeper than the abstraction of
team-as-entity and organization-as-entity. Because process empathy is
generic across bureaucracies, the benefit of this perspective is that
you can gain insight about people you don't know doing work you don't
understand. Each application will have nuances specific to the people
involved and the shared resource being managed, but process empathy
provides a useful framework for navigating bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Process empathy involves asking questions about your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What <span data-acronym-label="incentives"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">incentives</span> do process
participants face? Consider the (lack of) <a
href="#sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples">feedback loops</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>What unaligned goals do individual bureaucrats have that cause
friction?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the different paths individual bureaucrats take to work
towards their goals? See the list of <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a> bureaucrats face.</p></li>
<li><p>How can you leverage the interplay between processes and
professional interpersonal relationships? See <a
href="#sec:reputation">reputation management</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than asking, "What benefits the team?" or "What supports the
organization?" the paradigm of process empathy focuses on people and
incentives. For example, to be effective you need to identify rules
(written and unwritten), determine who enforces what, consider the
detection mechanics for rule-breaking, and weigh the consequences of
subversion against the benefits of breaking rules.</p>
<p>Developing process empathy does not mean that you trust the people
involved. Process empathy does not mean trusting in the process. Faith
in bureaucracy is certainly misplaced. Understanding bureaucracy better
allows you to actively remedy the inefficiencies and deficiencies. You
need to build an understanding of what the process is for a given policy
managing a <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span>.</p>
<p>The question "When is process empathy applicable?" is answered by
"When bureaucracy is present." A clear understanding of bureaucracy is
necessary for building your process empathy.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="what-is-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> What is Bureaucracy?<span
id="sec:define-bureaucracy" label="sec:define-bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>While you may know it when you see or experience bureaucracy<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, for this book definitions are
helpful. Throughout the book I'll refer back to these definitions as I
explain concepts needed to understand bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy involves the creation and execution of policies for
managing shared resources. Creating and carrying out policies usually
involves multiple people, each having a specialized role. Motivated by
scalability (how many widgets), complexity (number of tasks per widget),
or latency (time per widget), members with distinct roles form a
hierarchical organization to facilitate coordination. The organization
has control over the disbursement of resources relevant to the society
the organization works within, or the organization administers a policy
within that society. Resources managed by the organization are either
tangible (e.g., water, air, land) or expertise (e.g., food inspection,
teaching mathematics, painting cars).</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is not limited to government. Non-profit organizations,
volunteer groups, commercial companies, and even small teams of people
can invoke bureaucratic tendencies. The existence of bureaucracy is
independent of an organization's purpose and independent of whether
money is involved. Carrying out someone else's subjectively defined
policy will require you to make subjective decisions regarding execution
and enforcement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Distinct roles can be identified within the description of bureaucracy.
A bureaucracy typically involves a policy creator, a policy enforcer,
and the person upon whom policy is inflicted. In the context of
government, the policy creator can be either a politician or a
bureaucrat. In the context of a family, the primary caretaker usually
sets policies.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">This unassuming family consists of a

then Dad helps enforce that policy. The shared resource being managed is
the dessert. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An organization comprised of bureaucrats is a <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span>. The main
character within a bureaucracy is the <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> -- the person who is
a member of an organization and is responsible for subjective
implementation of policy for the organization. The person that a
bureaucrat's decisions are inflicted on is a <span
data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>. Depending on context,
a subject may be a student (when the bureaucrat is a teacher) or a
subject may be a citizen if the bureaucrat is a police officer or
government official. Sometimes a bureaucrat's decisions are inflicted on
other bureaucrats-as-subjects, such as when a Chief of Police creates
guidelines for police in their district, or when a senior diplomat sets
policies for embassy employees.</p>
<p>A <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> subjectively
interprets policies on behalf of their organization and has
discretionary enforcement. The bureaucrat's purpose is to facilitate
coordination of stakeholders by applying specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>Let's break that previous paragraph down piece-by-piece. First,
"subjective interpretation" means a person is making a decision about
how to do something. Subjectivity arises from different reasons one
person might choose an option over a competing alternative. A <span
data-acronym-label="policy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">policy</span> is a set of actions in
a given circumstance. An <span data-acronym-label="organization"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">organization</span> is the collection
of people for who the policy is made. Discretionary enforcement means
the bureaucrat chooses how to apply the policy in specific
circumstances. Facilitating coordination means bureaucracy is about
getting multiple people (or sometimes a person at different instances in
time) to work together. The stakeholders are people who care about the
application of the action in each circumstance. That's still pretty
dense, so the rest of the book is spent expanding the nuances and
implications of this definition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Bureaucracy is neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is not tied to
politics, nor is bureaucracy specific to an institution (e.g.,
corporations, governments, academia). The definition of bureaucracy used
in this book is independent of government. Bureaucracy is not defined to
be efficient, nor does it have to be inefficient. Bureaucracy is not
restricted to paperwork, record keeping, quantification, or gathering
metrics. Nothing in this definition involves paperwork or an office
building. Definitions that limit the concept of bureaucracy to specific
contexts result in a decreased ability to describe complex, large-scale
organizations of humans. If your definition of bureaucracy is limited to
government, then you'll be confused by similar behavior showing up in
small groups of volunteers and in commercial businesses.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is about delegation of control, communication,
decision-making, coordination, and processes. A vital aspect of
bureaucracy is that everything is arbitrary -- as determined by
humans.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/am_I_a_bureaucrat.png" id="fig:am-I-a-bureaucrat"
style="width:105.0%" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Decision tree for determining whether you
qualify as a bureaucrat. Start in the upper left corner, then evaluate
the sequence of questions to determine which label applies to your
situation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The consequence of subjectivity is that everything is negotiable.
Bureaucracy relies on negotiation to adjust to nuanced circumstances not
foreseen when policies were designed. You (whether in the role of a
subject or a bureaucrat) need to know who to negotiate with and how to
negotiate the changes you seek.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is arbitrary, but there are actual rules that constrain
us. The mathematical physics that describe nature are not negotiable.
Everything in your environment is either naturally occurring macroscopic
emergent phenomena (e.g., chemistry, biology) or humans making up labels
and norms. Distinguishing the two is critical to knowing what you can
change and what you have to work within. See figure&nbsp;<a
href="#fig:am-I-a-bureaucrat" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:am-I-a-bureaucrat">2.2</a> for an illustration of
the decision sequence.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy arises when there is no standard, objectively
quantifiable feedback mechanism for individual participants in the
organization. This aspect is why governments, schools, and prisons are
characterized as bureaucratic. The military doesn't rank soldiers by
"number of enemies killed" and is bureaucratic. Even profit-driven
commercial organizations are bureaucratic when the actions of individual
employees are not coupled to the metrics of profit.</p>
<p>Profit-based feedback makes some roles in a business context slightly
more predictable and understandable. Even in that situation there are
subjective trade-offs like what costs get externalized and whether to
focus on long-term profit versus short-term profit.</p>
<p>The concept of bureaucracy is most visible for complex recurring
situations involving many people and the control of a shared resource.
The apparent friction of bureaucratic processes can be lower when there
are only a few people involved ("I'm just talking to my collaborator,"
or "I'm just buying groceries from a clerk at the store," or "I'm using
a website for a government service"), but there is a continuous gradient
to more obvious instances of bureaucracy. Bureaucratic tendencies are
observable at the small scale, but in that limit it becomes difficult to
distinguish what is attributable to the participants involved.</p>
<p>Operating within an organization of bureaucrats feels different from
other parts of your life because of the apparent interdependence and
loss of autonomy. Modern conveniences are designed to hide bureaucracy
and create the illusion of independence. Aspects of modern life like
electricity, water, sewage, safety, and entertainment all operate at a
scale that makes dependence on other humans almost invisible. You
probably don't know the person who wired your house, runs the electrical
power plant, monitors the flow of clean water, or treats sewage. A
breakdown of those services is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leaky
abstraction</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Bureaucracy arises when management of a shared resource is necessary.
That resource can be external to the organization or internal to the
organization. Examples of external shared resources include mail
delivery for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service">USPS</a>,
public safety for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation">FBI</a>,
and the environment for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">EPA</a>.
The focus of this book is on resources internal to an organization.
Intangible resources internal to a bureaucratic organization include
attention, skill, and expertise. Those shared internal resources get
quantified as time, money, and staffing. While talking about time and
money and staffing are easy to make trade-offs with, keep in mind they
are proxy measures for the central intangible resources like attention
and expertise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Bureaucracy is a system for distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making. That is in contrast to easier-to-understand concepts
like centralized knowledge and centralized decision-making. A government
run by dictatorship is easier to conceptualize than democracy because
there is a central character around which a narrative can be formed.
Similarly, stories about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> of
a company are easier than capturing the thousands of interactions
conducted by the many employees of that company. The vast majority of
the work an organization does is coordinated and carried out by people
other than the CEO. Most of what is known within an organization is
known by people other than the CEO. Linear storytelling with a small
number of main characters does not map well to the complexities of
bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="the-scope-of-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The Scope of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is a trait of an organization: we call organizations
bureaucratic. This is consistent with the definition of bureaucracy
based on managing <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span>. Examples of
organizations considered bureaucratic include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection
Agency</a> (EPA) manages access to bureaucrats who have expertise with
environmental regulations governing water, air, workplace safety,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.intelligence.gov/">United States
Intelligence Community</a> manages access to bureaucrats who have
expertise in collecting foreign intelligence.</p></li>
<li><p>The information technology department in a large organization
manages staff with expertise in repairing computers.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats in the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug
Administration</a> (FDA) use their expertise to regulate food safety to
serve their community.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats of the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/">Federal
Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) have expertise on flight safety to
protect their community.</p></li>
<li><p>The military manages the shared resource of bureaucrats with
expertise in war-making.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These descriptions of bureaucracy are conceptually consistent but
don't provide value to you, the practicing bureaucrat. Bureaucracy is
not a distant, faceless concept. Bureaucracy permeates your environment
and is the basis for many interactions you have with other people.</p>
<p>When you recognize bureaucracy specific to your environment, you will
be able to respond appropriately. If you recognize the systemic
incentives driving a person's behavior, you are less likely to see the
person as malicious or incompetent. You are also more likely to be able
to negotiate with them and enact the changes that you seek.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="who-is-a-bureaucrat">Who is a
Bureaucrat?</h3>
<p>A cashier in a gas station is a bureaucrat. The shared resource is
the gas and other items for sale. The "policy" might be "take money from
customer in exchange for items sold in the store and gas from the
pumps," but the subjective application of that policy leaves a lot of
room for the cashier to shape the customer's experience. Does the
cashier greet the customer when the customer enters the store? Does the
cashier look at the customer to acknowledge the customer? Smile? How
quickly does the cashier engage the customer? Minor nuances left to the
cashier in the execution of the store policy mean there is room for
subjective application of the policy.</p>
<p>A bank teller, a loan officer, and a bank's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support">technical
support</a> are all bureaucrats. The shared resource includes money the
bank manages and the expertise associated with managing money. Each
employee subjectively enforces policies on behalf of the organization.
Each role has a different amount of impact on the bank's finances. Of
these three roles, the loan officer's interactions with bank customers
provide the most straightforward route for feedback based on profit. The
loan officer doesn't act alone though -- the customer's interactions with
tellers and the bank's technical systems also matter to the customer's
decision about how and where to manage money.</p>
<p>This same discretionary application of policy applies to commercial
bureaucrats like sandwich makers, car salespeople, oil well drillers,
grocery clerks, retail clerks, and plumbers. Public school teachers,
state and federal police, military members, tax collectors, and other
state workers are government bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Factory line workers subjectively apply policies, with the assembly
line and factory being the shared resource. Enforcement of quality
standards is a subjective policy. The pacing of work is a negotiation
with management that directly impacts productivity and profits. The
feedback loop for factory workers from profit generated by the product
is weak and diffuse.</p>
<p>Structured environments like sports featuring well-defined rules do
not eliminate bureaucracy. Teammates use subjective policies on who to
work with and how to best leverage their strengths and exploit the
opponent's weaknesses. The policies are set in part by the coach.
Referees make subjective determinations about rules.</p>
<p>Sometimes bureaucrats do not work directly with customers or citizens
or products. Then the bureaucratic process is inflicted on fellow
bureaucrats. In that scenario, a bureaucrat is subjectively applying a
policy to other bureaucrats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
Identifying yourself as a bureaucrat matters because the label informs
the responsibilities of your role. The risk of not self-identifying as a
bureaucrat is that you won't grasp how much control you have in enacting
and enforcing policy. If you think of yourself as having to blindly
follow rules, you will harm the people you are applying the rules to and
the organization you are applying the rules for. The value of having
capacity for judgment is so you can adapt policies to circumstances.
Power is merely decisions that alter the opportunities of other people.
Your perception of what decisions are available determine how much power
you have.</p>
<p>In a similar sense from the consumer's or citizen's perspective, if
you don't think you are interacting with a bureaucracy, you won't
perceive the opportunity to negotiate. If you view rules as unchanging
and inflexible, you will harm your ability to make progress. If a human
made a rule, then that rule is flexible. Who made the rule? Who enforces
the rule? If you can talk to them, could they be convinced to make a
modification or an exception? Sometimes the answer is yes.</p>
<p>If you don't think about the bureaucratic framing, you might think
the store clerk is enforcing a policy because they don't like you.
Assigning personality conflict as the cause might lead to a different
conversation with their manager (the person who created the policy).</p>
<p>If you don't think of yourself as a bureaucrat, you may behave
passively in your job. The paradigm of "just tell me what to do" is the
default (learned in school) and you won't know how to engage with
coworkers and bosses since their role is distinct from that of a friend.
You will be less likely to understand how to leverage members of your
organization. Thinking from a bureaucrat's perspective explains why
communicating within your organization is critical to your success and
the organization's success.</p>
<p>If you think of yourself as merely a cog in a machine, you are less
likely to notice that you exert influence in the process and you are
less likely to recognize the autonomy available to you. If you think "I
have a real job (e.g., nurse, cashier, teacher); therefore I'm not a
bureaucrat," you are less likely to recognize the subjective power you
have in interactions with the public. If you think, "I'm at the bottom
of my organization's hierarchy; therefore I do not have power," you are
less likely to notice autonomy when it is available.</p>
<p>If you don't consider yourself to be part of a bureaucratic process,
you'll behave differently in interactions with bureaucrats. You won't
perceive opportunities to negotiate because the processes seem fixed
instead of subjective. You won't recognize motives and incentives of
bureaucrats, so their activities will seem incomprehensible. Once you
identify as an important part of the bureaucratic process, you will be
able to effectively engage, negotiate, and make meaningful changes
happen.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="factors-influencing-bureaucracy">Factors
Influencing Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Although bureaucracy can be present for one person, and bureaucracy
is often apparent on teams (e.g., 3 to 20 people), this book focuses on
the situation of multiple teams comprising an organization. The size of
an organization might be a few hundred people (above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number">Dunbar's
number</a>) up to millions of people. Examples of companies that employ
more than a million people<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> include Walmart, Amazon,
and McDonald's. Size isn't a requirement for bureaucracy. Small
companies with a few people incur bureaucracy because of the need to
coordinate subjective policies governing shared resources.</p>
<p>Money is uncorrelated with bureaucracy. Bureaucracy occurs in
commercial companies, government, and non-profit organizations. Money
can help align incentives and provide feedback loops to inform behavior,
but it can also be the source of administrivia and policies.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy emerges in small organizations, has scale-invariant
patterns, and is generic across sectors. The complexity of the tasks may
differ, but the same scale-independent patterns emerge because of a
common factor: human behavior.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy scales with the complexity associated with a shared
resource. For example, if participants in a society only used hand tools
they could make themselves, then there is little need for bureaucracy.
Mining and producing small amounts of metal is feasible for an
individual, though the relevance of specialization becomes clearer. A
society large enough to support the technology of writing (beyond the
use of clay tablets) seems to coincide with the bureaucratic need for
writing. Getting to technology like the telegraph and radio requires a
society that supports complex processes and specialization -- key
features of bureaucratic systems. While decreasing accidental
bureaucracy is feasible, there is some essential bureaucracy<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> necessary for maintaining the
current level of technological sophistication.</p>
<p>In addition to essential task complexity, the size of bureaucracy
depends on accidental factors like how old the bureaucracy is, how big
the community being supported is, and how diverse the community is.</p>

<p>Bureaucracy is a system of distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making for managing shared resources. The decision-making is
not purely logical; it relies on particular facets of human interaction.
This section outlines the critical roles of decision-making, hierarchy,
communication in bureaucracy, and feedback loops. My list is smaller
than Max Weber's&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2015_Weber">(Weber
2015)</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and I see bureaucracy as more
widespread.</p>
<p><a href="#sec:decision-making">Decision-making</a> is central to
bureaucracy. Every other aspect of bureaucracy derives from
decision-making. The decision-making in bureaucracy is for the
subjective management of resources. In my definition of bureaucracy,
"shared resources" refers to both expertise and tangible goods like air,
water, and land.</p>
<p>When there are multiple people present, or even when one person is
trying to be self-consistent, coordination of decision-making is crucial
to the management of shared resources. Who gets to make which decision
is managed using <a href="#sec:hierarchy-of-roles">hierarchy</a>. While
coordination can occur without hierarchy when there are a small number
of people, typically an organization of people leads to both formal and
informal hierarchies.</p>
<p><a href="#sec:meetings-for-coordination">Meetings</a> and <a
href="#sec:written-communication">written communication</a> help with
consensus among bureaucrats, though agreement isn't necessarily the
outcome. Once a decision is made, the choice selected by a bureaucrat
propagates throughout the organization to achieve some level of
consistency.</p>
<p>A less prominent feature of bureaucracy is the weak <span
data-acronym-label="feedback loop"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">feedback loop</span>. This
distinguishes bureaucracy from a market-based system where the
consequences of decisions manifest as profits and losses. If you sell
shoes, you can evaluate decisions you've made by measuring how much
money you make. In contrast, the decisions of a bureaucrat are barely
felt by the bureaucrat. That weak feedback loop (few consequences for
the decision-maker) means learning from mistakes is harder and positive
reinforcement for good outcomes is negligible. A weak feedback loop does
not mean there are no consequences. The actions of a bureaucrat create
ripples that other people feel. This is described in more detail in the
section on <a href="#sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples">feedback loops and
ripples</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If you're not an academic researcher of bureaucracy, you might think
that you don't want to think about hierarchy, collaboration, or
coordination. Meetings and email are not your goal; you just want to do
the tasks trained for.</p>
<p>As you progressed through school you were graded as an individual
student. Now that you are employed your job has pay, promotion,
hiring/firing, and a title. School, and now employment, may seem focused
on your abilities (instead of on the class you're in or the team you're
a member of). The following sections explain why the individualist
mentality is ineffective when you are part of a system of distributed
knowledge and distributed decision-making.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="fundamental-decision-making-in-a-bureaucracy">Fundamental:
Decision-making in a Bureaucracy<span id="sec:decision-making"
label="sec:decision-making"></span></h3>
<p>Decisions are central to the operation of a bureaucratic
organization. In this book we explore the topic of decisions, but
decisions are not the only source of change in an organization.
Occasionally events unfold without decisions being made either because
the decision-makers are not informed or there is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willful_blindness">intentional
neglect</a>. This book focuses on situations where bureaucrats recognize
the need for a decision and want to make the best decision.</p>
<p>There are multiple types of decisions. A <span
data-acronym-label="simple decision"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">simple decision</span> has one
correct or beneficial choice and one or more wrong or harmful choices.
The work of decision-making is then to gather information that
identifies the correct or beneficial choice and select that option.</p>
<p>The best case scenario for any decision-making is one person making a
well-informed, simple decision that has immediate consequence and the
consequence is to the decision-maker. Examples from elementary school
include arithmetic math problems, multiple-choice quizzes, spelling
tests, and memorization tests. A bureaucrat's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_injury">moral injury</a> comes
from decision-making that involves multiple people, weak feedback loops
with high latency, and complex decisions with multiple objectives.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.4.0.1"
id="example-decision-method-pareto-frontier"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4.0.1</span> Example Decision Method:
Pareto Frontier<span id="sec:pareto" label="sec:pareto"></span></h4>
<p>A complex decision may have many choices, and there may not be a best
option. There are formal techniques for navigating the process of
arriving at a result. One approach for describing the situation is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front">Pareto frontier</a>.
If a Pareto frontier exists, then you can evaluate trade-offs.</p>
<p>As an example of a complex decision made by one person with immediate
consequence and direct relevance to the decision-maker, suppose you want
to buy a car. You care about only two aspects: fuel efficiency and cost.
See Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:pareto_frontier_cars" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:pareto_frontier_cars">2.3</a> for an example of the
Pareto frontier.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/pareto_frontier_car_options.png"
id="fig:pareto_frontier_cars" style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Four cars: L, M, N, and P. The buyer's
goal is to spend less money (lower on the vertical axis) and get better
fuel efficiency (right on the horizontal axis). Choices not on the
frontier should be avoided, but that doesn't yield a single
result.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Visualizing a Pareto frontier for two quantitative variables is easy,
but typically decisions involve more factors. For example, evaluating
the trade-off of three quantitative variables like passenger capacity,
cost, and fuel efficiency creates a surface. With more than three
variables visualization is less useful, though the analysis technique
still applies.</p>
<p>Another constraint on using Pareto frontier analysis is that it works
well when there are many options relative to the number of variables you
are optimizing for. The assessment does not work well when there are few
choices relative to the number of variables. For example, suppose there
are five choices of car and you want high fuel efficiency, sufficient
cargo capacity, maximum number of passengers, stylish, low cost, low
maintenance, good durability, and high resale value. Then defining a
Pareto frontier is less helpful.</p>
<p>For a set of quantitative variables, a Pareto frontier does not
account for the relative importance of different variables. Assigning
weights to each of these factors merely stretches one axis relative to
the other axes.</p>
<p>There are many possible frameworks besides Pareto frontiers, but in
practice a typical bureaucratic decision is ill-informed, has diffuse
consequences, delayed impact, and does not affect the decision-maker. In
bureaucratic processes there is rarely a formal assessment of options.
Decisions are rarely recorded. Even afterward a decision can be
difficult to evaluate for correctness because there are multiple
stakeholders.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: If the people you want to convince are not swayed by
data, then you can augment the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit
analysis</a> with stories.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.4.0.2" id="risks-of-using-decision-frameworks"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4.0.2</span> Risks of Using Decision
Frameworks</h4>
<p>Frameworks can be attractive to bureaucrats intending to formalize <a
href="#sec:process">processes</a> and encourage predictability. There
are potential risks worth being aware of. Cost-benefit analysis can
decrease the apparent responsibility of the decision-maker. Cost-benefit
analysis can be used to deflect criticism for an action.</p>
<p>A decision is political when the basis is historical relationships,
maintenance or creation of a relationship, or to enable future
relationships. A decision is subjective when someone else faced with the
same scenario would have come to a different conclusion. A decision is
quantitative when based on measurements. To avoid the appearance of
subjective decision-making or political decision-making, a bureaucrat
may frame a decision as "data-driven." A good approach for data-driven
quantitative analysis involves coming up with a testable hypothesis,
pre-registering what actions are to be taken after assessing the
results, then performing experiments and collecting data to evaluate the
hypothesis.</p>
<p>More commonly, a decision is made, then data is gathered which
supports the desired outcome. Forming an opinion and then looking for
evidence to back the outcome yields suboptimal results for the
organization. The value to the individual using that suboptimal approach
is extracted from other members of the organization or subjects of the
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Even when a bureaucrat is not intentionally biased towards an
outcome, there are many ways to gather evidence. Some approaches have
biased sampling and produce biased results.</p>
<p>Even with valid and representative data measurement, decision-makers
can be led astray by poor modeling. A model may use inapplicable
techniques or may have implementation bugs.</p>
<p>For all the dangers described above, there are worse approaches that
do not rely on measurement. People rely on history (if they are aware of
it) and perpetuate bad ideas, or take action based on what is best for
their career, or decide based on how to accumulate more power, or choose
based on what someone else says to do.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.4.0.3" id="alternative-approaches"><span

<p>Identifying the spectrum of ways bureaucrats make decisions can

id="why-cost-benefit-analysis-models-are-not-used"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4.0.4</span> Why cost-benefit analysis
models are not used</h4>
<p>Applying quantitative models to decision-making may seem a valuable
path to optimal outcomes. Improved decision-making that benefits
stakeholders seems attractive. There are various reasons this approach
is not taken. I outline the reasoning here not out of cynicism, but so
that you can appropriately respond when confronted with arguments
against <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit
modeling</a>. Decreasing your surprise through the inoculation of
exposure enables you to develop counterarguments.</p>
<p>One reason to avoid cost-benefit modeling is that there is a lot of
work to do, so coming up with a model is an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity
cost</a>. Modeling every decision in detail is unrealistic, so triage is
needed -- which decisions warrant what degree of investment in analysis.
A person inexperienced in modeling decisions will take longer and is
more likely to create a bad model. Practice designing models is
expensive. Identifying relevant parameters for inclusion in a model is a
learnable skill.</p>
<p>If a person has a bad experience with cost-benefit modeling, they may
be less likely to try again with other decisions. Bad experiences can
come from using incorrect data, missing a critical variable, picking the
wrong scope for a question, implementing the right model with the wrong
math, misinterpreting the result, using a model that is too in-depth or
not sufficiently deep, or failing to sell the result of an analysis to
stakeholders.</p>
<p>Quantitative cost-benefit modeling doesn't account for personalities
or organizational politics. The best options may decrease the decider's
power or prestige, or harm relationships.</p>
<p>Measurements are needed to inform a cost-benefit analysis. In
addition to measurement being costly, measurements get perverted -- see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law">Campbell's
law</a>.</p>

class="header-section-number">2.4.0.5</span> Decision-Making Delay<span
id="sec:decision-delay" label="sec:decision-delay"></span></h4>
<p>From an outsider's view, what appears as "organizational inertia" is
the delay of internal decision-making and the delay of dissemination.
Delay comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time used by each decision-maker to gather information, arrive at
a decision, change processes, disseminate their choice, and justify
their choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Processes designed to detect and counter cheaters and people with
malicious intent, whether that means a malicious bureaucrat or malicious
subject.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">Analysis
paralysis</a> due to insufficient information, too much information, and
lack of clarity about which framing is applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>When other people who are needed to carry out the action push
back, either in disagreement or seeking clarification. If the impact on
profit doesn't exist or is indirect, then justification for action isn't
quantitatively obvious. Therefore there's a higher burden for
communication.</p></li>

<h4 data-number="2.4.0.6"
id="a-bureaucratic-decision-involves-many-decisions"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4.0.6</span> A Bureaucratic Decision
involves many Decisions</h4>
<p>A decision is a collection of interdependent choices. After
recognizing the need for a decision, follow-on decisions include
identifying the stakeholders (who to include in an analysis) and
identifying options. Who is a stakeholder and what options are available
is interrelated. Involving more people expands the number of options and
the complexity of coordination. Additional choices associated with
reducing uncertainty are how much time to spend on the decision, how
much information to gather for the decision (see Dilemma&nbsp;<a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little">4.18</a>),
whether to make the decision or push the decision to someone with more
expertise (see Dilemma&nbsp;<a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-scope-of-speaking"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-scope-of-speaking">4.40</a>), or
whether to push the decision to someone with more exposure to the
consequences.</p>
<p>Most decisions you make as a bureaucrat do not have hard deadlines.
Instead, there are trade-offs in the allocation of your attention.
Sooner is preferable since the consequence of the decision benefits the
organization and allows you to focus on other tasks, but delaying allows
you to gather more information for a better-informed decision. See
Dilemma&nbsp;<a href="#table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little">4.18</a>
and <a href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">other related Dilemmas</a>.</p>
<p>If a bureaucrat relies on consulting an <a
href="#sec:expertise">expert</a>, the decision-maker needs to be
confident the expert is not straying outside their area of expertise.
For example, I don't rely on a botanist to tell me how to change the oil
in my car. Besides knowing their limitations, the expert should be clear
about whether their input is a factual summary, a predictive assessment,
or a value judgment. This complicates what you as a bureaucrat are
interested in when deciding what's the best choice.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.4.0.7" id="transparency-of-decision-making"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4.0.7</span> Transparency of
Decision-Making<span id="sec:transparency-of-decisions"
label="sec:transparency-of-decisions"></span></h4>
<p>Your process might change if made visible to stakeholders. You may
provide more precise justifications or spend more time gathering
evidence to support a claim. Strengthening the arguments is beneficial
but takes time and resources.</p>
<p>Frank conversations and exploratory brainstorming need protections to
allow participants to be vulnerable. This is the motive for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House
Rule</a>. The concept of transparency can apply before a decision is
issued, while a policy is in effect, or after the consequence (as part
of a review). Making decisions as part of a transparent process can make
participants more risk-averse because of the potential for failure.</p>
<p>People affected by the decisions benefit from understanding how the
decisions were made -- see examples like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_in_the_Sunshine_Act">Sunshine
laws</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)">FOIA</a>.

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="fundamental-hierarchy-of-roles">Fundamental:
Hierarchy of Roles<span id="sec:hierarchy-of-roles"
label="sec:hierarchy-of-roles"></span></h3>
<p>In an ideal situation, one person would have sufficient depth and
breadth for decision-making. That might not be possible in every
situation. One way to resolve this is to identify distinct scopes of
responsibility and then assign different members of an organization
separate scopes for decision-making. Within a decision-making scope
there may be more work than one person can handle, so a team is formed.
That team may have some members focused on tactical work and other
members focused on strategy and coordination. Hierarchy within an
organization is the formalization of separate decision-making scopes and
associated specialization.</p>
<p>Partitioning knowledge and decision-making enable complex work beyond
what one person can accomplish and causes friction among members. An
expert reporting to a manager knows things the manager does not, and the
manager may have context that the expert lacks. Both bureaucrats (the
expert and the manager) need to convey their respective understanding
and seek a holistic view.</p>
<p>Hierarchical decision-making is one option for coordination among
alternatives (like consensus), so why is hierarchy so common? Members of
an organization gravitate towards hierarchy because it helps define task
scope, assigns responsibility, and obviates a need for building
consensus. Reaching consensus for every decision would take time and be
more burdensome than appointing a person as the decision-maker.</p>
<p>Organizations that try to be flatter (more employees per manager)
saturate the attention of managers. More discussions that everyone has
to pay attention to so they don't miss something happening. The opposite
design (fewer employees per manager) is less noisy but results in silos
of reporting because lateral coordination is more challenging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A hierarchical organization with partitioned knowledge introduces a
challenge: the order in which you share information with others matters.
Your choices for who to first describe an idea to are your peers, your
management, and your subordinates. The people subordinate to you know
more about the topic and are exposed to the consequences. Giving them a
chance to vet the idea results in a more robust idea and validates their
value in the organization. Alternatively, first sharing your idea with
management allows your superiors to provide context you might not be
aware of. And choosing to start the conversation with your peers first
indicates you value the relationship and decreases the risk of
duplicating work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I've included hierarchy in the section on Fundamentals of Bureaucracy,
but that does not imply that hierarchy is a required feature of
bureaucracy. Hierarchies of bureaucrats are a conventional <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure">organizational
structure</a> and are worth studying even if not essential to
bureaucracy. Understanding hierarchy is relevant to identifying
recurring behavior and patterns to leverage. Organizations of
bureaucrats can intentionally work against the use of hierarchy for
decisions, but the amount of effort needed to enable alternatives
results in hierarchy being a common approach.</p>
<p>The benefits of formal hierarchy include improved capacity for the
number of policy decisions made, enabling consistency of decisions, and
leveraging specialization of knowledge. Hierarchical decision-making has
costs: higher latency (compared to a single decider), inconsistency
among bureaucrats (dissemination isn't perfect), waste due to
inefficiency, and <a href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">many others</a>. As
another example of the potential for harm, hierarchy enables strategic
ignorance. Bureaucrats in positions of power can deny knowing of
improper activity.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Whether that is a problem or
benefit depends on your role.</p>
<p>The structure of an organization is dynamic, but at each point in
time an organization typically has a defined set of roles. Different
scopes of decision authority distinguish each role. Roles are often
confused with titles. What matters is the role (scope of decisions) and
who reports to whom. The names of teams can be similarly not
descriptive.</p>
<p>Boundaries of responsibility define roles in an organization. The
purpose of a role is to minimize conflict, decrease the need for
coordination, reduce redundancy, and allow for control of resources.
Clear boundaries of responsibility enable effective bureaucracy.</p>
<p>A conventional characterization of an organization's hierarchy
involves two criteria: the depth and breadth of the <span
data-acronym-label="org chart" data-acronym-form="singular+short">org
chart</span>. The more people a supervisor oversees, the flatter the
organization -- that's the breadth of the organization. The depth of the
hierarchy is how many layers there are. See the Valve handbook&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="2012_Valve">(unknown 2012)</span> and
Joreen's essay&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="1972_Joreen">(Freeman
1972)</span> for contrasting views on the merits of an organization's
hierarchy.</p>
<p>A more practical view of an organization's hierarchy also involves
two criteria. The two choices that shape hierarchy are 1) how many
people a supervisor oversees and 2) how many supervisors a person has.
You might naively expect that an employee has one boss, but that is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management">not a
requirement</a>. A supervisor for a given topic may have many people
reporting to them, and a bureaucrat with multiple roles may report to
more than one supervisor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Acting as part of a group means ceding part of your autonomy. Hierarchy
cedes some of your responsibility and adds expectations about
relationships. The consequence of hierarchy in an organization is that,
as a member of the bureaucracy, you do not have full autonomy --
otherwise you would not be a member of the hierarchy. At the same time,
you are not under strict control of the organization -- you still have
some subjective authority as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The person at the top of the hierarchy does not know everything. The
person at the top of the hierarchy does not have input on every decision
made in the organization. All members of the bureaucracy retain some
autonomy.</p>
<p>Independent of the defined roles and titles in an organization's
hierarchy, there are a set of implicit roles and a separate social
hierarchy of informal influencers and decision-makers. Informal
influencers in a bureaucracy usually have long relationships with the
decision-maker, relevant credentials, or both. The credentials can be
formal (e.g., a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy">PhD</a>) or
informal (demonstrated success on a project). In either case, the
decision-maker is relying on another person's expertise.</p>
<p>Another set of informal relationships within an organization is
between mentors and mentees. These relations allow mentors to share
institutional knowledge with mentees and enable people in senior
positions to access the novice perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
One consequence of hierarchy is a sense of fear felt by people who
report to other people. This fear stems from the loss of control (less
autonomy) that leaves the person feeling disempowered.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following relationship. Sue is perceived to
have power over another person, Amy, because Amy gave up some control to
Sue. Amy not having complete control over decisions triggers the feeling
of fear in Amy, regardless of how Sue behaves. (See Figure&nbsp;<a
href="#fig:subordinate_and_supervisor" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:subordinate_and_supervisor">2.5</a>.) Having
complete responsibility for decisions also induces anxiety.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sue and Amy discuss a work-related topic.
The person with less perceived power can feel fear associated with loss
of control.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If Sue is aware of the potential for this emotional experience, Sue
can compensate for Amy's fear by being friendly and receptive towards
Amy. Alternatively Sue may exploit or rely on the fear felt by
subordinates. Sue not noticing or accounting for Amy's fear does not
invalidate Amy's emotional experience.</p>

Coordination<span id="sec:meetings-for-coordination"
label="sec:meetings-for-coordination"></span></h3>
<p>In an organization comprised of more than one person, meetings are
necessary to facilitate coordination. The coordination accomplished by a
meeting can be explicit (verbal or written), or it can be indirect
through signaling (who attended the meeting, when the meeting was held,
where the meeting was held, or how much notice was provided).</p>
<p>Not everyone understands that meetings are vital to coordination in a
bureaucracy. The following sequence of scenarios illustrates the
thinking some bureaucrats use. If you're already convinced of the value
of meetings, see <a href="#sec:well-run-meeting">tips on
improvement</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: No plan or coordination needed; I just do
what you tell me. With this approach, either I will be successful
because I worked hard on what my supervisor directed, or I will fail
because my supervisor directed me to do the wrong thing.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: You are smart, and you're
capable of shaping your career. Let's work as a team to improve your
effectiveness.<br />
<em>Another potential response by the supervisor</em>: Is that how you
want your career to go? Do you desire autonomy and creativity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: No point in making a plan or coordinating
because everything changes so often.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: But the work has an end
goal, right?<br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: Yes, so then the plan is to get from where
we are now to that end goal. Coordinate as necessary.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: And there are no
intermediary steps? Milestones? Is it better to have no plans and just
put out fires as a reaction, or to have a plan with contingencies that
are subject to change?</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Meeting to discuss the value of
coordination.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: What is a plan anyways?<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: There is value in
collaboratively specifying a goal, enumerating tasks that would support
the goal, identifying the dependencies among the sub-tasks, and
time-binning the dependencies with defined milestones and deliverables.
That is my definition of a plan. And having that is more useful than
merely reacting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: Who's plan? Who's relationships? I don't
need to come up with that plan, the supervisor already has a plan. Just
tell me what the plan is.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: That's not as effective
as coming up with independent plans and then resolving the differences.
There's value in resolving the differences, even though that will cost
time and frustration and displace time to enact the plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Not every team member in a bureaucracy is against planning, or as
obstinate about collaboration. My intent for sharing these debates is
that you will be less surprised when your coworkers raise them.</p>

<p>Paperwork, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape">red
tape</a>, and modern electronic forms are closely associated with
bureaucracy. Digital reports, spreadsheets, and emails are the current
technological artifacts of an organization's bureaucracy. A written
record creates evidence about policies, justifications, and decisions
regardless of format. Written records are burdensome to create and
maintain and search, but they are not intrinsically good or bad.</p>

id="fundamental-feedback-loops-and-ripples">Fundamental: Feedback loops
and Ripples<span id="sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples"
label="sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples"></span></h3>
<p>A feedback loop exists when a decision-maker experiences the harms
and benefits of their decision. Decisions that lack a feedback loop
still have consequences for the decision-maker, in that potential future
decisions are altered or limited.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Virtuous cycles and vicious cycles are rare in bureaucratic
organizations because there are rarely mechanisms for feedback loops.
Instead, there are <span data-acronym-label="ripple"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">ripples</span> -- propagation of
consequences for other people's schedules, altering what is possible for
other people, and creating dependent tasks to be carried out by people
other than the decision-maker.</p>
<p>The weak feedback mechanisms for a bureaucrat are reputation (subject
to spin) and rarely enforced retroactive accountability in the form of
the question, "What did you know and when did you know it?" Retroactive
accountability depends on written records from meeting notes, emails,
agendas, and reports. Reducing the potential for retroactive
accountability is one motive for bureaucrats avoiding written records
for decisions and policies.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of quantitative feedback loops for bureaucrats,
there is significant interest in documenting justification, proactive
monitoring, reporting, and retroactive assessment. Each of those
activities creates more administrivia.</p>
<p>When there are multiple competing objectives among stakeholders in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum</a> use
of resources, how can you determine what's best? In some domains there
are feedback loops to guide progress. When feedback loops are weak or
not present, the most powerful stakeholder (potentially distinct from
the biggest or loudest) will dominate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Because feedback loops are weak for decision-makers, alternative
mechanisms are needed in bureaucracy. A standard approach is the use of
approvals and justifications. The strength of justification needed for a
given action depends on your relationship with the approver and the
potential ripples associated with the action.</p>
<p>The amount of justification for an approval process should be just
enough so that when something goes wrong there's a clear reason why.</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="special-interest-groups">Special interest
groups</h4>
<p>Within bureaucratic organizations special interest groups care about
aspects of the shared resource central to the organization. Inefficiency
can occur when there is a benefit to a small group and the cost is to a
larger group.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_trap">social
trap</a></p>
<p>is "a conflict of interest or perverse incentive where individuals or
a group of people act to obtain short-term individual gains, which in
the long run leads to a loss for the group as a whole." The feedback
loop for the diffused value relevant to the organization is weaker than
the feedback loop for value to the interest group.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="spending-taxpayer-dollars">Spending taxpayer
dollars</h4>
<p>As an example of a weak feedback loop, consider the scenario of a
government employee deciding how to spend government money.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Suppose you are a government bureaucrat and earn $100,000 with a tax
rate of 30%. Then your tax money sent to the government is $30,000. How
does that compare to what the government collects in taxes?</p>
<p>For the United States, "in 2021 the government collected $4.05
trillion in revenue."<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>That means your taxes of $30,000 would be 30000/4050000000000 =
0.00000074% of the tax base for the country.</p>
<p>If you are a federal government bureaucrat and you do not maximize
the effectiveness of spending $1,000,000 of government money, of that
misallocated money only $0.0074, or about one penny, was taxes you paid.
The financial feedback loop is weak.</p>
<p>Some federal government bureaucrats earn slightly more, so the cost
of wasting $1,000,000 is more significant. Federal pay is limited to
about $220,000<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>, raising the feedback to 2
pennies.</p>
</div>
<p>The lack of feedback allows waste to go unfelt. There's no immediate
consequence for the decision-maker.</p>

<div class="mdframed">
<p>A coworker and I were going through passport control at an airport. A
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration">TSA
officer</a> directing passengers into one of two lines. Both lines were
long. The length of each line was not equal even though the entrance to
the lines was at the same location. Each line terminated at a row of
passport-checking agents. Each passport check took a minute.
Passport-checking TSA officers operate independently and
concurrently.</p>
<p>The TSA officer's perspective is that there are two long lines. Her
procedure is two balance the two lines (for fairness). He does this by
pointing people into one of the two lines, with her choice driven by
which line appears to have room available.</p>
<p>My coworker and I enter the controlled area and are directed into
lines by the TSA officer. The officer directs my coworker left and
directs me to go right. The TSA officer completed her job.</p>
<p>My coworker in the left line finishes 5 minutes before me. This
difference in completion time is frustrating for me.</p>
<p>Because the lines are not of equal length, balancing the start of the
line is a suboptimal method. The consequence is that what seems fair to
the TSA officer ends up not being fair for people going through the
line. The TSA officer had incomplete information -- the lines are not of
equal length. Because the TSA officer isn't exposed to the consequence
of her approach, she doesn't get feedback on whether her decisions are
suboptimal or not.</p>
</div>
<p>Lesson: if the people making decisions do not experience the
consequences of those decisions, then they have no incentive to improve
decision-making.</p>
<p>The person in the longer line feels frustrated. The negative feeling
is due to a sense of powerlessness, the situation is recurring, and a
better solution is available.</p>
<p>The optimal solution in this situation is to have a single line
feeding the multiple TSA passport checkers. A single line eliminates the
need for the decision-maker but incurs work to change the status
quo.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Bob parks his car in a parking garage every day. The parking garage
owner charges $20 per day for people to park their car.</p>
<p>Bob recently found that one of the exit gates for the parking garage
is broken. If Bob uses that gate to leave the parking garage, the gate
does not function and Bob cannot exit. Then Bob has to call the parking
gate operator to request an exception (which is granted) and Bob can
then exit that gate, avoiding the $20 per day charge.</p>
<p>This action (go to broken gate, request exception, avoid charge) has
been repeated for a long time (months). Bob's motive is to avoid the $20
parking charge; the cost is a mere phone call and a minor delay. This
cheating behavior harms the parking garage owner's income. However, the
parking gate operator, serving as intermediary, insulates the parking
garage owner from interaction with the cheater. The cheating behavior is
small enough that the parking garage owner may not notice.</p>
</div>
<p>Having an intermediary policy enforcer alleviates the need for the
garage owner to interact with customers. If the incentives of
stakeholders are not aligned then inefficiency goes unchecked. If the
parking garage operator's profits are a fixed rate rather than tied to
parking charges, then the operator lacks the motive to fix problems.</p>

shared resources&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2016_Suchak">(Suchak
et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Though bureaucracy is not new, the pervasiveness is. Before the
industrial revolution the scale of employment and government were small,
with organizations limited by the speed of communication. For the past
100+ years the size of organizations (commercial, governmental, and
academia) have grown beyond <a

Impossible</h2>
<p>The only situation where bureaucracy might not exist is if you live
entirely independently and have no interaction with other people. That
means completely disengaging from society. Even then, personal routines
are a self-imposed form of bureaucracy, with the roles of policy maker,
bureaucrat, and subject collapsed to a single person -- you.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency and autonomy are attractive alternatives to
bureaucracy. The way participants in modern society strive for
self-sufficiency is by denying their dependence on modern society.
That's a relabeling of selfishness which feels better.</p>
<p>For the rest of us who operate as members of society, bureaucracy is
necessary for our rights. You validate your name using paperwork, forms,
and records. These artifacts are used, in cooperation with other people,
to determine your claim of citizenship and associated rights. That's a
subjective policy that <span data-acronym-label="stakeholder"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">stakeholders</span> in society agree
to.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is necessary because it is a response to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem">collective
action problem</a>. As long as humans form communities, we will address
the challenge of shared resources -- whether tangible (water, land, air)
or intangible (expertise). That is why bureaucracy is culturally
invariant and persistent across time. Learning to be an effective
bureaucrat improves your chances of success in society.</p>
<p>The specific way a society is constructed (democratic, authoritarian,
dictatorship, anarchy) is irrelevant -- bureaucracy is still present.
Even the libertarian approach of relying on contract enforcement implies
some bureaucracy (e.g., forums for resolving contract disputes like a
court system).</p>
<p>Not all bureaucracy is due to the state, nor is bureaucracy confined
to companies. Parenting involves creating situation-specific
requirements for children, with the organization being the family as
mentioned in the section on <a
href="#sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood">bureaucracy in childhood</a>.
Dress codes for sports teams are arbitrary standards. Store clerks are
bureaucrats, as are website forum moderators. Content moderation is the
process of (inconsistently) enforcing arbitrary standards. This mindset
even permeates individuals as internalized expectations of policy and
enforcement when no one else is present.</p>
<p>Recognizing instances of bureaucracy enables more skillful
interaction, whether as a bureaucrat or subject. The rest of this

bureaucracy as a <span data-acronym-label="subject"

class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Each Phase of Life Involves
Bureaucracy</h2>
<p><em>Summary</em>: You have experience with bureaucracy, though you
may not have framed the experiences as bureaucratic. Viewing
relationships and roles through the lens of bureaucracy explains the
limitations of your expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In each person's life there are standard milestones: birth, education,
work, and death. Each of these milestones and phases involves
bureaucracy. Each phase is a different experience of bureaucracy because
the bureaucratic roles change.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is composed of three roles: the policy creator, the
policy enforcer, and the subject (upon whom the policy is inflicted).
These roles can be confounded by oversubscribing the label "bureaucrat."
Who is the bureaucrat and who is the subject depends on the relationship
in a scenario.</p>
<p>For example, a store manager creates a policy, a store clerk enforces
the policy, and the policy is inflicted on the customer. Both the
manager and the store clerk would be bureaucrats, while the customer is
the subject. In a separate example, someone at corporate headquarters
sets a policy, the store manager enforces it, and the policy is
inflicted on the store clerk. Then the clerk was the subject of
bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-of-birth">Bureaucracy of
Birth<span id="sec:bureacracy-of-birth"
label="sec:bureacracy-of-birth"></span></h3>
<p>Your birth was marked by getting a name, registering with the state,
and initiating medical records. These tasks were administered by
bureaucrats (doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff) on your behalf,
and you were the subject of the bureaucracy. You had no autonomy or
decision-making authority.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-in-early-childhood">Bureaucracy
in Early Childhood<span id="sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood"
label="sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood"></span></h3>
<p>Before starting formal education, the bureaucracy of early childhood
is inflicted primarily by family members setting and carrying out
policies. The organization of bureaucrats is the family, with the shared
resources being housing, food, and experience with survival. Other
community members or caretakers may also be involved in carrying out the
policies of taking care of you. Your decision-making authority as a
subject in this bureaucracy was minimal.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucrats-at-school">Bureaucrats at
School<span id="sec:bureaucracy-of-school"
label="sec:bureaucracy-of-school"></span></h3>
<p>Once you started the formal education process, new bureaucrats got
involved. The community of bureaucrats could be a public school, a
private school, or homeschooling. In any of those cases, the frontline
bureaucrat is the teacher. You're not responsible for making policies
that other people follow; you are still the subject of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The expectations of each phase of school (high school, undergraduate,
graduate school) are distinct, and they are different from working in a
large organization. Your autonomy increases throughout the duration of
school. Your family and teachers are the bureaucrats. You start building
informal organizations of friends, and you start to explore policies
around social bonding.</p>
<p>Schooling sets a pattern that most students will fall into for the
rest of their lives: you were handed a textbook and told to solve a set
of problems. That pattern of taking direction can persist for a long
time. However, you are not constrained to persist with that limitation.
You have the autonomy to do more than what is required. You can find
other textbooks that match your interests or are written from a
different view.</p>
<p>You get to choose the book you want, even if you don't get to choose
the topic you will be evaluated on. You don't need to pick just one
reference book -- you can review lots of books and figure out which
author style best fits you. You can also choose the level of difficulty
-- basic and beginner level, or more advanced. You can choose what's best
based on your understanding rather than defer to what a class in school
is supposed to cover.</p>
<p>As a subject of the education bureaucracy, you can discover how you
learn best. This extra effort requires self-reflection: How do you
learn? What works best? What didn't work, and why not? What did you
learn? What do you wish you had learned?</p>
<p>Another pattern that schooling relies on is single-question decisions
with only one right answer. Examples include math problems and
multiple-choice tests. Schooling tends to avoid setting up dilemmas or
paradoxes for students. Academic problems in the education process are
designed to be independent of the people involved or the history of the
situation.</p>
<p>In my schooling I learned how to approach technical issues and
develop solutions. That problem-solution paradigm neglects the crucial
steps of discovering the problem, isolating the challenge, identifying
stakeholders, learning the history of the challenge, and negotiating
with stakeholders before trying to address the challenge.</p>
<p>My schooling led me to emphasize academics over socializing. When I
transitioned to professional work, I found social skills and political
savvy useful when trying to change organizations and policies.</p>
<p>Academic problems are intended to be solvable and answers submitted
get evaluated. In contrast, working in a bureaucratic organization the
challenges are ill-defined, there's no known solution, and the topic is
sufficiently complex that you have to collaborate.</p>

Understanding the bureaucracy of healthcare is outside the scope of this
book, but your role in the bureaucracy is helpful to understand.</p>
<p>Doctors, nurses, and other staff are bureaucrats; you are the
subject; the hospital or clinic is the organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
To illustrate bureaucracy of a large organization, consider the
importance of toilet paper at a hospital.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>If you go to a hospital, use the bathroom, and find there is no
toilet paper, that would indicate a deficiency of the hospital.</p>
<p>The <em>holistic view</em> is that someone didn't refill the toilet
paper. Since the person who usually restocks toilet paper wasn't also a
user, they aren't directly affected by the lack of toilet paper.</p>
<p>A routine is needed for checking the availability of toilet paper in
bathrooms.</p>
<p>The <em>perspective of the purchasing manager</em> is that money
spent checking the status of toilet paper is money not spent on the
hospital's primary mission: improving the health of community
members.</p>
<p>Minimizing checking of toilet paper is important for the
organization's reputation, so a feedback mechanism is instituted: a
phone number is posted in the bathroom so users can send a text
regarding bathroom status at the hospital.</p>
<p>The <em>perspective of the janitor</em> is that my routine used to be
to go to each bathroom after normal business hours and refill toilet
paper. Now I have to do that and be on-call when someone alerts
management that service is needed. My responsibilities increased but my
pay did not.</p>
</div>
<p>Bureaucracy is a set of subjectively administered policies within an
organization. By recognizing the role of bureaucrats you can identify
what is negotiable.</p>

<p>A common refrain for participants in an organization is "Can't I just
do the work?" with the implicit disinterest in coordination and
administrivia. In this section we'll explore a few alternatives to
bureaucracy. These thought experiments illustrate the na&#xEF;ve intent and
the practical deficiencies of each alternative.</p>
<p>The models of bureaucracy below are all imprecise because they are
analogies. The consequence of imprecision is wasted effort. Using a
precise and accurate definition of bureaucracy enables improved
effectiveness for the work you invest.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="alternative-efficient-bureaucracy"><em>Alternative</em>: Efficient
Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>In an ideal scenario with no inefficiency, everyone comes to the same
conclusion when presented with the same information regarding management
of shared resources. Efficient bureaucracy requires each person to know
the skills of everyone else so that anyone can act as an expert in any
field.</p>
<p>In this scenario the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(business)">overhead
cost</a> of building consensus becomes unnecessary. There is no need to
fight over resources (e.g., money, staffing) and no need to fight over
what the direction of the organization should be. In this model of
efficient bureaucracy based on everyone having the same view, a
potential problem is the lack of diverse views needed to enable
resilient organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
While that idealized scenario is unrealistic, it points to how to
improve bureaucratic efficiency. Each bureaucrat should have access to
the same information (transparency). Each bureaucrat should apply the
same decision-making process consistently (documented processes and
policies). Each bureaucrat should have the same incentives (fair
policies).</p>
<p>The unrealistic model of efficient bureaucracy also points to why
bureaucracy is inefficient in predictable ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not everyone has the same information.</p></li>
<li><p>Processes are applied inconsistently.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#sec:motivations">Incentives vary</a> among
bureaucrats.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats and Subjects use imprecise language.</p></li>
<li><p>Decision-makers use opinions and experience rather than collect
data and analyze data.</p></li>
<li><p>People prioritize putting out fires rather than attacking
critical issues.</p></li>
<li><p>People do not respond quickly (or at all) to communications
(e.g., email, phone, meetings). See the section on <a
href="#sec:slowing-communication">slow communication</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants are late to meetings.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#sec:scope-creep">Scope creep</a> for projects incurs
additional (unnecessary) work.</p></li>
<li><p>Planned scope and actual scope are mismatched (due to staffing or
skills).</p></li>
<li><p>Teams work in silos and create redundancy.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats and Subjects lie and employ other dark patterns (not
addressed in this book).</p></li>
<li><p>People make mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>Each person's reference experiences are unique.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By identifying why bureaucracy is inefficient you can actively work
to remedy each of the above aspects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Consider the following <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment">thought
experiment</a>. What if everybody in a bureaucracy had a different
opinion? How would consensus be arrived at? Can an organization operate
without having agree on every decision?</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="alternative-perfect-bureaucracy"><em>Alternative</em>: Perfect
Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The definition of "perfect bureaucracy" depends on who provides the
perspective. Here I illustrate both the subject's view and the
bureaucrat's view.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the subject of a bureaucratic organization,
perfect bureaucracy means many things: minimizing the time the subject
waits on a decision, getting perfectly correct decisions, decisions are
consistent across subjects (Dilemma&nbsp;<a
href="#table:dilemma-subject-consistency-per-situation"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-subject-consistency-per-situation">4.61</a>)
and circumstances (Dilemma&nbsp;<a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-policy-consistency-across-cases"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-policy-consistency-across-cases">4.37</a>),
decisions take into account all relevant factors, and there is zero cost
to the subject (Dilemma&nbsp;<a href="#table:dilemma-subject-transparency"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-subject-transparency">4.63</a>). Any
situation deviating from those expectations is a noticeable detriment to
the subject, leading to a negative reference experience of
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Never mind that the desires are unreasonable and conflicting. In a
real (i.e., imperfect) bureaucracy, subjects have a negative or neutral
experience. Positive interactions with bureaucracy are rare and are
regarded as abnormal.</p>
<p>Perfect bureaucracy for a bureaucrat means all information is
available, information is immediately available, and there is no moral
ambiguity (i.e., each answer is objective). Trade-offs become trivial
and the emotional toll of the work goes to zero. Then the bureaucrat can
serve subjects (an emotionally rewarding prospect).</p>
<p>This job in a perfect bureaucracy might feel hollow if all decisions
are obvious. In a real (imperfect) bureaucracy, the typical experience
is negative or neutral, punctuated by glimpses of satisfaction.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="alternative-everyone-does-their-own-thing-no-coordination-no-bureaucracy"><em>Alternative</em>:
Everyone does their own thing -- No Coordination, No Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The scenario involving minimal bureaucracy is a single person working
on a single task that does not last long (a few minutes), is relatively
easy (cognitively, physically, and emotionally), and does not recur. In
that situation, building consensus is irrelevant and no process is
required. Even then, it is often the case that this simple task involves
using shared limited resources -- essentials like water, air, and land.
If your task involves use of those things, then how is fair use
determined among consumers?</p>
<p>For simplistic tasks the concept of community-imposed limits to
access shared resources is not trivial. When there are no policies to
constrain access, violence is used to determine allocation of shared
resources.</p>
<p>Most of your actions occur beyond the limits of simplicity and thus
incur some concept of <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> (breaking a task into
subtasks). Staying with the context of one person, a complex task can
benefit from being broken into subtasks. Sometimes the order of the
subtasks matters, so we need to track the dependencies. A recurring
multi-step process with documentation is starting to have features of
bureaucracy, but lacks the need for consensus.</p>
<p>If one person lacks the skills relevant to a multi-step process, they
may engage another person to help. The interaction occurs on a spectrum
from informal (anarchy) to formalized in a contract (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">libertarian</a>). If
the parties working on the task fail to reach consensus, what is the
recourse? Choices include physical violence, threats, or involving a
third party (e.g., a court with lawyers and judges).</p>
<p>If a community wants to manage shared resources, how is that policy
decided? Building consensus is relevant, but what is the process for
establishing consensus? <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism">Nepotism</a>, cultural
norms, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religious
practices</a> served this role before the dominance of bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="alternative-limit-bureaucracy-to-a-single-decider"><em>Alternative</em>:
Limit Bureaucracy to a Single Decider<span id="sec:single-decider"
label="sec:single-decider"></span></h3>
<p>Since bureaucracy is distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making, it could be replaced by centralized knowledge and
centralized decision-making. If we are going to live in a society and
coordinate shared resources, what if we had a single person deciding?
How fast could that be? Good decisions are not instantaneous -- there is
latency in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">OODA
loop</a> model.</p>
<p>The input for the OODA model is to observe and the output is to act.
Observing and acting are measurable; the "orienting" and "deciding"
phases are not as easy to measure. The "orient" phase requires labeling
data received in the "observe" phase and connecting that information to
what is already known.</p>
<p>How quickly could a single decision-maker apply the OODA loop for
arbitrary questions about <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span> accessed by a
community? Three minutes is not much time to gather information and
share it with the relevant people, but let's set that as a lower bound.
If a single decision takes three minutes, then in a ten-hour work day
that's a max of <span class="math inline">\((10*60)/3 = 200\)</span>
decisions per day. If this decider works 300 days out of the year, that
gets us to 60,000 decisions per year. While 60,000 decisions sound like
a lot, that limits how large the community could feasibly be, and the
complexity of the decisions is limited.</p>
<p>Everyone has to talk to this decider directly since there's no
bureaucracy to gather or disseminate the information. The diversity of
questions regarding shared resources would be challenging to answer
well.</p>
<p>Within the constraint of a single decider we can't just automate
everything because carrying out the automation requires staff to
implement. Automation isn't free -- it requires creation and maintenance.
Unless the same person making the decisions is also creating and
maintaining the system, there will be multiple people in an
organization.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy">Monarchies</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator">dictatorships</a> at
first glance seem to rely on a single decider. This is a simple model to
understand, but addressing all the edge cases for a large society is
difficult. A single decider doesn't scale for the number of decisions
needed, so the decider then appoints bureaucrats to subjectively enforce
policies.</p>
<p>From this thought experiment we conclude that avoiding bureaucracy by
relying on one person doesn't scale. More people are needed to develop
and carry out policies.</p>
<p>If there's more than one person in an organization, then
communication for coordination takes time. That's the "orient" phase of
the OODA loop. Time spent orienting decreases the decision throughput of
the organization.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="alternative-avoid-bureaucracy-and-just-use-common-sense"><em>Alternative</em>:
Avoid Bureaucracy and Just use Common Sense</h3>
<p><em>Claim</em>: Everything would go smoothly if each person used
common sense.</p>
<p>Common sense relies on reference experiences, cultural norms,
incentives, emotional state, and a lack of psychological defects. These
aspects are particular to each person in an organization. This gives
rise to the observation that "common sense is not so common."</p>
<p>There are multiple origins of what gets considered to be common
sense:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cultural norms. This is what I think everyone else does or
thinks.</p></li>
<li><p>Personal <span data-acronym-label="reference experience"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">reference experience</span>. I've
done it this way before.</p></li>
<li><p>A prescribed action seems obvious.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Proponents of commonsense who work in existing hierarchical
bureaucracies may advocate removal of non-workers (i.e., management).
That may sound like a worker's paradise, but then who coordinates the
activities when the number of people is above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's
number</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
To illustrate the dissonance motivating common sense, consider the
following. Changing a burnt-out light bulb at home takes me only a few
minutes. I've done that many times. Why is that task so hard in an
organization?</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>In a large organization comprised of specialized roles, an office
worker sees a bulb is out. Rather than go to a nearby hardware store and
buy a replacement, they notify their manager who notifies the building
supervisor who submits a request to the maintenance team.</p>
<p>The maintenance service desk team then schedules the repair. An order
of 1000 replacement bulbs was made last year and there are some still
available in storage. A maintenance team is assigned to the task and
deployed to replace the bulb.</p>
<p>First the maintenance team goes to the storage facility to get a
ladder and multiple bulbs of multiple models. The team has to sign out
the bulbs from storage so inventory can be tracked (because of prior
incidents of theft). A team is needed because solo use of the ladder is
prohibited (for safety, also born out of previous incidents). Multiple
bulb models are needed because which model is required is unspecified in
the service ticket. Having multiple bulbs available decreases the need
to go back to storage.</p>
<p>Once on site, the maintenance staff finds the bulb is a new type and
needs to be ordered. Maintenance team notifies the supervisor. The
building manager files a new maintenance request.</p>
</div>
<p>This is the efficiency of specialization of roles. If you don't like
it, you could go to the hardware store, buy a bulb, rent a ladder,
install the bulb, and return the ladder.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="alternative-completely-avoid-bureaucracy"><em>Alternative</em>:
Completely Avoid Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The phrasing of avoidance is more precisely worded by replacing
"bureaucracy" with "coordination of stakeholders." If you avoid
coordination of stakeholders, you either are constrained to only work on
tasks that involve one person, or you get random (uncoordinated)
interactions.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="alternative-minimize-bureaucracy"><em>Alternative</em>: Minimize
Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Again, try replacing "bureaucracy" with "coordination of
stakeholders." The goal of "minimizing coordination" probably isn't the
real objective. To be more precise, a specific objective might be
"minimize time spent executing the task" (which takes a lot of
coordination before the task execution) or "minimize the level of
distraction to stakeholders" (chunk the coordination time, e.g., a
meeting). Another strategy for minimizing bureaucracy is to reduce the
number of stakeholders involved. For a given task complexity, this means
having smarter people who have more skills. See figure&nbsp;<a

id="alternative-automation-of-processes-to-displace-bureaucracy"><em>Alternative</em>:
Automation of Processes to Displace Bureaucracy<span id="sec:automation"
label="sec:automation"></span></h3>
<p>The role of automation is to make interactions more predictable,
faster, and to handle more of them. Automation does not eliminate
bureaucracy; automation obfuscates the subjective decisions and limits
the ability to negotiate with decision-makers.</p>
<p>Hoping that modern technology will eliminate or reduce bureaucracy is
not a shortcut to progress. Even with faster decisions and fewer humans,
there is still reliance on humans to make decisions and design
processes.</p>
<p>There are benefits to automation, and automation can be enacted to
minimize harm to bureaucratic subjects. Automated systems can be made
more transparent by including documentation about what is happening,
why, and what's next. Documentation helps bureaucrats and subjects
identify when assumptions made in the automation are incorrect.</p>
<p>There are indicators of when to transition from a manual bureaucratic
process to a more automated approach:<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The process to be automated is stable.</p></li>

<li><p>The process logic relies on objective evaluation
criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>The process is frequent.</p></li>

<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="alternative-market-based-approach"><em>Alternative</em>:
Market-based Approach</h3>
<p>There is an alternative to bureaucracy that features a decentralized
approach to complex tasks and avoids reliance on consensus: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)">markets</a>.</p>
<p>An oversimplified definition<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> is "A market is a
medium that allows buyers and sellers of a specific good or service to
interact to facilitate an exchange." In practice, there is market
friction: "trading is always associated with certain costs or
restraints." <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The sources of friction in a market include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Commissions on trades.</p></li>
<li><p>Taxes (needed to fund contract enforcement
organizations).</p></li>
<li><p>Uncertainty in hiring.</p></li>
<li><p>Constraints on firing labor.</p></li>
<li><p>Search cost in exploring the available opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>Risk uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost of creating contracts.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost of insurance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Market friction and bureaucratic inefficiency are similar.<a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Complex tasks at a societal scale range from manufacturing advanced
computer chips, to creating and distributing critical medicine, to
immigration and border enforcement. If a society wants to carry out a
complex task involving multiple people, then coordination of effort is
required. The coordination can be explicit (in the form of a
bureaucracy) or implicit (via a market). Bureaucracy is one response to
the complexity of a problem being solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Regardless of whether a bureaucratic or market-based approach is used to
mediate access to <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span>, distributed
knowledge and distributed decision-making are hindered by aspects like
limited bandwidth between people participating in the coordination,
non-zero latency of information between people, the cost of getting
data, and the cost of analysis of data. Due to these factors, suboptimal
decisions get made. See the discussion of <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a> for specific examples of
trade-offs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The objective and quantified concept of money creates accountability
that distinguishes commercial businesses from bureaucracy. Money as a
metric is common to all participants within the business and with
external stakeholders.</p>
<p>As with government bureaucrats, commercial businesses have employees
who make subjective decisions and enforce policies. Unlike government
bureaucracy, in business there is a common metric for feedback: money.
This distinction between business and government is not as clear as you
might expect since the feedback mechanism does not apply to all members
of a business. An effective commercial bureaucrat may rely on the
success of other employees rather than a direct interaction with
customers. Business employees may take action that is hard to quantify
with respect to profits and losses.</p>
<p>Companies are motivated by financial profit, whereas bureaucracies
like prisons, schools, hospitals, governments, and militaries consume
and spend money, but money isn't the goal. When faced with a decision,
bureaucrats are not guided by which will generate more profit&nbsp;<span

<p>Governments are composed of politicians and bureaucrats. (Government

<p>The concept of political representatives is easier to understand. A
politician is just one person acting in that behalf of other people.
Members of the community get a vote in who that representative is. In
contrast, the emergent behavior of bureaucracy is more challenging to
understand: many people are involved (which inhibits creation of an
explanatory narrative) and subjects of bureaucracy do not appoint the
bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Suppose that instead of a bureaucracy all members of an organization

label="sec:alternative-views-from-within"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy <a href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">as I have defined
it</a> is not the only way that bureaucrats perceive their environment.
To understand their situation, bureaucrats typically consider
themselves, their work, their subjects, their coworkers, their
superiors, and their subordinates. Complicating this approach, the <a
href="#sec:motivations">motives of an individual bureaucrat</a> for an
activity vary. The variance of motivations is even more complicated when
a request incurs more work, there's no deadline, and no reward. What is
your incentive? Is it emotional approval? Relationship building? Social
approval?</p>
<p>Most bureaucrats don't self-identify as bureaucrats even if they do
recognize they operate in a bureaucratic organization. The common
paradigm is, "I'm an engineer and the company I work for is
bureaucratic," or "I'm a manager and my team is distracted by too much
administrativia," or "Paul must not like me, he doesn't respond to my
messages."</p>
<p>As a consequence of not thinking about the bureaucratic system you
operate within, a typical response is to develop heuristics that fit the
recurring patterns you've experienced. Unlike relying on an explanatory
theory, heuristics evolve as you encounter novel situations. While that
feels like learning, the heuristics you develop are specific to your
motives and your experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The perspectives below are archetypal for bureaucrats who don't consider
bureaucracy <a href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">as defined</a> in this
book. In practice, a practitioner's perspective might be a mixture of
these views.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is what I can do with my skills
and the resources I have access to.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: This person is task oriented. Results are what
matters. The intricacies of bureaucracy are a distraction to getting the
work done. Communication for coordination is a distraction from work
being done by the individual. This bureaucrat may have the perception
that if they participate in the community then they will be blamed when
things go wrong. The emotional reward for this person is doing or
completing the task. This person is likely to say to their manager,
"Tell me what I need to do to be successful" rather than identify
collaborations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is how I feel.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your feelings are real. They have consequence, in
that your emotions affect motivation and enthusiasm. However, a
feelings-centric perspective may not be productive for you, your team,
or the organization. Brainstorming can feel unpredictable. Challenging
statements made by coworkers may feel intimidating. Talking about tough
topics is emotionally difficult. Being effective means compromise and
some people may not get everything they wanted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What matters is how others feel.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Depending on the emotional state of those around
you is unhealthy and can be unproductive. Working for the happiness or
satisfaction of other people is risky -- they may not know what's best,
or they may not have your interests in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What matters are my immediate coworkers.</strong><br />
An approach to avoiding thinking about bureaucracy is to characterize
interactions with other people merely as personal relationships. That is
easier than seeing bureaucracy as the complex system that it is.</p>
<p>This perspective can be positive (e.g., I collaborate with those
around me) or negative (e.g., I am in competition with those around me).
In this scenario everything beyond the local scope is personified or
ignored.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your relationships do matter. However, they are not
all that matters. Missing from this view is the ability to explain what
is happening outside the immediately observable realm. This "just
relationships" view misses emergent phenomena and over-simplifies the
situation. As a result your effectiveness is decreased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Just because you are a bureaucrat doesn't mean you have a well-informed
understanding of bureaucracy. Regardless of which above perspective is
held, a bureaucrat experiences the difficulties of operating within an
organization. A bureaucrat can rationalize to themselves why things
don't work in their organization with stories like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Other people are lazy and don't want to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Other people are inexperienced.</p></li>
<li><p>Other people don't care.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are lazy people, inexperienced people, and people who don't
care in any given organization. Those are not unique to bureaucracy and
do not explain bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The bureaucrat who uses the explanations like laziness, lack of
experience, and lack of care applies them to people he or she hasn't
directly interacted with. The bureaucrat using these explanations may
not realize other people could apply those same stories to the
bureaucrat.</p>

class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Models of Bureaucracy that are
Incomplete<span id="sec:models-of-bureaucracy"
label="sec:models-of-bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>Coming up with a holistic theory of bureaucracy is desirable but
difficult. Bureaucracy exists in every society, so having an explanatory
theory would help identify which aspects are essential and which are
accidental. Having a theory of bureaucracy could help identify what
should be improved and what should be discarded. An expectation for the
existence of a theory stems from the repeated independent creation of
bureaucracy in diverse societies in different time periods.</p>
<p>Characterizing bureaucracy is difficult because organizations
comprised of unique humans are aware of attempts to be characterized and
respond to stories told about bureaucracy; see the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne
effect</a>. As soon as a claim about aspects that characterize
bureaucracy is made, then an individual can respond to that claim by
behaving in an opposing manner. Worse still for the theory, bureaucrats
can coordinate amongst themselves to provide counterexamples.</p>
<p>In the following section I outline a few conventional ways of
modeling bureaucracy to point out the shortcomings of each model. The
relevance to the practicing bureaucrat of familiarity with these models
is that you know the boundaries of each model. Awareness of the
limitations of each model enables you to know when the model is an
applicable story and when the model is not explanatory.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-as-a-machine">Bureaucracy as a
Machine</h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: Bureaucracy is a machine that has throughput and
latency and dependencies and mechanisms. Bureaucrats are cogs in that
machine.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: Bureaucracy can be complicated and
feel mechanical with standardization, top-down dictates, and
interlocking processes. There is a risk of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation">deindividuation</a>
for bureaucrats.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: Perceiving yourself as a cog in the
machine implies a loss of agency. This is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy">self-fulfilling
prophecy</a> -- if you think you don't have agency, then you may stop
acting as though you have agency.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-as-an-economic-model">Bureaucracy
as an Economic model</h3>
<p><em>Narrative 1</em>: Bureaucracy is a collection of individual
rational actors.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: Individual bureaucrats cooperate or
compete to promote their self-interests. The culture of an organization
is a result of individual self-interests of each bureaucrat. Individuals
make decisions that promote their self-interests.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: This view is hard to distinguish
from a marketplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Narrative 2</em>: Bureaucracy is comprised of competing
special-interest groups.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: The observation of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice">Public Choice
theory</a> is that a concentrated minority that stands to gain a
disproportionate benefit will act in their self-interest.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: In a generic bureaucratic
organization it is not clear which team would be more concentrated than
any other team, nor is it clear what the disproportionate benefit might
be. There is a concentrated minority at the top of any hierarchy, and
the top of the hierarchy does act in their self-interest, though this is
not particular to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations may have specific teams with access to
disproportionate benefits, but this book focuses on generic bureaucratic
features. Effective bureaucrats are all alike; every bureaucrat is
ineffective in their own way.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Narrative 3</em>: A Bureaucracy is a subcategory of a Firm.<br />
Firms exist in a market because negotiating contracts and prices for
every interaction is burdensome. A bureaucracy could be considered to be
a type of firm that specializes at the organizational level in policy
administration or resource management.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: This is correct.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="bureaucracy-as-an-emergent-phenomenon">Bureaucracy as an Emergent
phenomenon</h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: There is a universality to bureaucracy in both
the diversity of scenarios and persistence across time that hints at <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a>.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: Bureaucracy as a macroscopic
phenomenon is emergent when there are a sufficient number of people
involved. The size of the organization is important because there is no
longer dependence on individual relationships (i.e., a size above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's
number</a>). There are people in the organization that you don't know
and therefore there is a lack of personal accountability. An
organization is subdivided into teams recursively until there is local
person-to-person accountability. The underlying behaviors that enable
emergence are bilateral interactions among humans and a lack of feedback
mechanisms.</p>
<p>At the scale of individual bureaucrats, each person is playing by
different rules, has different goals, and meanwhile everything is
changing -- both the individuals and the conditions. Above the threshold
for the emergence of bureaucracy there is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance">scale-free
behavior</a>. The same patterns are observable at large organizations
and extremely large organizations. A bureaucrat in one organization
recognizes patterns of professional life experienced by bureaucrats at
another organization. The local mechanisms bureaucrats employ to enable
distributed decisions using distributed knowledge include meetings,
processes, and communications. While local nuances differ, a generic
pattern is apparent.</p>
<p>The choices faced by an individual bureaucrat are interdependent with
the choices made by other bureaucrats in their environment. There is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)">flocking
behavior</a> where my choices are informed by the choices of those
around me. Unlike flocking of birds, the adjacency metric for
bureaucrats is not necessarily spatial distance. Instead, visibility of
the decisions and consequences inform adjacency.</p>
<p>The relevance of claiming bureaucracy is emergent is that there is
behavior occurring at the macroscopic scale. Knowing the motives and
actions of every individual bureaucrat at the microscopic level is not
relevant. Treating organizations as complex and adaptive systems gives
insight on how to work within the dynamic environment&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="2011_Eisenhardt">(Eisenhardt and Piezunka
2011)</span>.</p>
<p>A colloquial interpretation of emergent behavior from complex
phenomena is treating the system as an entity -- personification. When an
organization is assigned behaviors&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2002_Gall">(Gall 2002)</span>, it is useful to remember that
the organization is comprised of individual bureaucrats.</p>
<p>More formally, there are distinct categories of emergence&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="2002_Bedau 2021_Carroll_168">(Bedau 2002;
Carroll 2021)</span>. Nominal emergence names the phenomena of a thing
being distinct from its constituents: a circle is emergent from a
collection of points; a pile of sand emerges from grains of sand. Merely
putting many bureaucrats in a room is insufficient to create
bureaucracy; there's more to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Weak emergence occurs when there are phenomena that are independent
of the underlying interactions. For example, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)">gliders</a>
in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's
Game of Life</a>. Weak emergence is measurable using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality">Granger
causality</a> or, equivalently,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_entropy">transfer
entropy</a> (information theory). I don't know how to apply these
measures to bureaucratic organizations.</p>
<p><em>What this model is missing</em>: The problem with treating an
organization as an entity is that apparent behavior is
counter-intuitive&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2002_Gall">(Gall
2002)</span>. Breaking the organization into individual people with
motives helps clarify causes of observed behavior.</p>
<p>In practice, bureaucracy is worse than emergent because the rules can
be altered or ignored by stakeholders. Bureaucracy is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked
problem</a>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="1973_Rittel">(Rittel and
Webber 1973)</span> which resists mathematical models.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-in-game-theory">Bureaucracy in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">Game Theory</a></h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: Bureaucracy is comprised of one or more <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_in_game_theory">games</a>
played by bureaucrats. Which game is applicable depends on the specifics
of the situation.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: Different bureaucrats have different
motives in distinct situations.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: While interactions among
bureaucrats may be describable in terms of games, that doesn't provide
an underlying motive for bureaucracy as an identifiable experience.</p>
<p>Defining bureaucracy as distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making for the subjective management of access to shared
resources does not fit as a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game">coordination
game</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperative_game_theory">competitive</a>
game. Bureaucracy is in constant flux due to external conditions,
externally imposed constraints, staff turnover, internal dilemmas, and
disagreements among individuals.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="bureaucracy-as-evolutionary-outcome">Bureaucracy as Evolutionary
Outcome</h3>
<p><em>Narrative 1</em>: Biological, Genetic evolution -- Individual
level.<br />
There might be biological arguments for a genetic basis for bureaucracy.
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: For example, Zebra fish and Hyenas
have a gene for dominance.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a><br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: "Genes code for proteins, so there
are no 'genes for' phenotypes per se, including behavioral
phenotypes."&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2015_Lilienfeld">(Lilienfeld et al. 2015)</span></p>
<p>Non-human animals make subjective decisions and do not get labeled as
bureaucrats. Humans make decisions that are not explained by
reproductive fitness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Narrative 2</em>: Biological, Genetic evolution -- Group
selection.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: <a
href="#sec:hierarchy-of-roles">Hierarchy</a> is not unique to humans.
Primates form social hierarchies based on dominance over shared
resources like mates and food.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: a gene for bureaucracy. A genetic

to be more effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Narrative 3</em>: <a

as a method for coordination is a better idea than <a

<em>What this model is missing</em>: Bureaucracy persists along with
nepotism and religion, and bureaucracy occurs within religion.</p>

id="bureaucracy-as-product-focused-narrative">Bureaucracy as
Product-focused Narrative</h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: Ignore the bureaucrats and instead focus on how a
product progresses through a process.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Ignoring bureaucrats involved in processes
simplifies the narrative (the product is the main character).
<em>Example</em>: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgVKvqTItto">School House Rock:

<p><em>Narrative</em>: Ignore the bureaucrats and instead focus on the

<em>Why this feels true</em>: The person experiencing bureaucracy as a
subject is confused by "why isn't this easier?"<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: The history of why the process
exists and how it evolved (i.e., legacy), protection against malicious
subjects, and protection against malicious bureaucrats.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="bureaucracy-as-psychological-phenomenon">Bureaucracy as

<p><em>Narrative</em>: Bureaucracy as a pure power struggle. Or the

inefficiency is attributable to a mashing together of distinct
individuals with conflicting desires. While this is true, it isn't
complete.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: Personality-focused narrative
neglects the history of processes (legacy), protection against malicious
subjects, and protection against malicious bureaucrats. Analysis that
stops at personalities misses emergent phenomena.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Each of the above models of bureaucracy has shortcomings. Knowing why
each model is not a complete description helps you avoid the trap of
thinking only in terms of a single model.</p>
<p>The rest of this book ignores these partial characterizations of
bureaucracy. Rather than take the external (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emic_and_etic">emic</a>) view of
bureaucracy, this book takes the internal (etic) perspective of a
bureaucrat operating within an organization. The description of
bureaucracy in this book is used to contextualize advice on how to be an
effective bureaucrat.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.6" id="not-many-options-for-organizations"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Not many Options for
Organizations</h2>
<p>When complaining about the ineptitude of organizations (or more
specifically, leaders, managers, subordinates, and coworkers), consider
the variables available to be modified. As a thought exercise, what
would it take to rebuild the organization you are in from scratch?</p>
<p>Listing the levers available for enacting change to an organization
is intended to emphasize the importance of personal interactions within
bureaucracy. When you get frustrated with apparent inefficiency,
consider the systemic changes available -- there aren't that many.
Options for the organization are limited, so the importance of your
creativity and informal influence is dominant in determining the
effectiveness of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Organizations comprised of bureaucrats have fewer options for change
than individual bureaucrats. The choices an individual bureaucrat faces
are described in the section on <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a>. In comparison, the choices
faced by the designers of an organization are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Flatness of organizational hierarchy -- how many layers of
oversight are there? Another way of arriving at the same structure is to
ask how many employees there are per supervisor.</p></li>
<li><p>Hierarchy split by function (all the lawyers in one team, all the
engineers in one team, all the sales people in one team) or by product
(mixing experts to solve a customer's problem)?</p></li>
<li><p>Size of organization. More people allows for more specialization
and requires more support.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizations are segmented into teams, and there are not many
options for segmentation: create a new team, merge existing teams, or
dissolve a team.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizations create processes for recurring tasks like hiring,
promotion (pay or title), awards, compensation, recognition,
professional training, and firing. Each of those has a set of design
choices that inform the organization's culture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a government bureaucracy, the constraints of some incentives like
pay and financial awards are set outside the organization. That further
constrains the ability of bureaucrats to shape their organization's
culture.</p>
<p>The organization may have policies and processes regarding hiring,
promotion, training, and firing, but the decision may be made by team
managers rather than top-level management.</p>
<p>Enumerating the choices an organization faces is only relevant in the
context of a desire to change. Individual bureaucrats can enact change,
and subjects of bureaucracy can request improvement, but those are weak
inputs. Organizations are accountable to their source of funding, not
the subjects of bureaucracy or members of the organization. For example,
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service">Internal
Revenue Service (IRS)</a> is accountable to Congress, not the taxpayer
or IRS employees.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="not-many-options-for-teams">Not many options
for Teams</h3>
<p>Similar to the limited number of options available for shaping
organizations, the structural choices faced by a team are constrained.
The relevance of listing what can be done is to again emphasize the
importance of personal relationships for effective bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Team managers might decide who gets hired and who gets promoted and
who goes to what training and who gets fired. Though in some
environments even that control is relegated to an external team. A team
manager usually has decision-making authority regarding tasks the team
works on.</p>
<p>Accountability in the context of teams comes from person-to-person
interactions. These can be either lateral (sideways) or parent-child
(top-down) or child-parent (bottom-up)&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2014_Jorgensen">(Jorgensen, Bruehl, and Franke 2014)</span>.
Each of these three categories has associated constraints.</p>
<p>The upward child-parent (bottom-up) communication is either
inadequate (too few updates, not enough information, or insufficient
context), relevant, or excessive. For example, a weekly or monthly
report to multiple superiors may be inadequate.</p>
<p>Finding the balance depends on the presenter knowing the individual
audience members so that a tailored message is provided and then
adapting to the specifics of the situation.</p>
<p>The downward parent-child communication either is inadequate (no
direction provided or imprecise direction provided), provides actionable
vision, or micromanagement. Finding the right balance and specificity
requires insight into the communication needs on both sides of the
relationship.</p>
<p>For lateral interactions among team members, the tension between
cooperation and competition manifests in struggles over money, staffing,
products (output), and resources (inputs). Here "resources" refers to
constraints like access to data, control of data, technology resources,
hardware, floor space, and expertise.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="teams-are-subdivisions-of-an-organization">Teams are Subdivisions of
an Organization</h3>
<p>A flat organization (more employees per manager) means more people
doing work instead of managing, but sufficiently large organizations are
typically broken into teams to make coordination less chaotic.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat on a team, you might expect that there are structural
ways to address challenges. In the context of altering teams, there are
only a few options available: create a new team, merge teams, or
dissolve a team.</p>
<p>Not all changes have to be structural; there are choices to be made
when operating within the existing hierarchy. For a given set of teams,
the lateral interactions are competitive or cooperative. Coordination is
required (or conflict will occur) for money, staffing, and resources.
Examples of resources include access to or control of data, computer
equipment, hardware, floor space, prestige, and ownership of
products.</p>
<p>The purpose of pointing out the variables that can be changed is that
there aren't many. As a consequence, the importance of relationships and
effective communication is more significant.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="roles-of-management-versus-leadership">Roles
of Management versus Leadership</h3>
<p>Teams include managers and leaders. Those roles are not necessarily
filled by the same person. By clarifying the distinction, you can
determine what to expect from various members of the hierarchy. A common
mistake is to expect leadership from managers.</p>
<p>A manager's role involves time management, task tracking, employee
evaluations, promotion, pay, requesting resources for team members, and
hiring. Sometimes the responsibilities of promotion, pay, and hiring are
split into a supervisor role, leaving task tracking and time management
to the project manager or product manager roles.</p>
<p>A leader's role focuses on coordinating vision and principles. The
vision and principles do not have to originate from the leader -- other
team members can contribute ideas. The leader's responsibility is
primarily social consensus and aligning the goals of members.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="sources-of-friction-between-teams-within-an-organization">Sources of
Friction between Teams within an Organization</h3>
<p>Ideally there is a clear division of responsibilities among different
teams. Having separate teams requires interaction among teams -- one team
may depend on the output from another team. Coordination among the teams
regarding the transfer of data, products, projects, or knowledge is
critical to the smooth operation of the organization. Separation allows
for de-duplication of work and easier transitions for work that spans
teams.</p>
<p>The division of responsibilities between teams can become unclear
because a team's scope tends to align with skills of the team members.
One team may be responsible for an aspect of a task workflow, but if
members of another team also have those skills (e.g., due to
cross-training), the separation between responsibilities can be
blurred.</p>
<p>Another factor that leads to friction is the constraint that
organizations have finite staffing, money, and time. Therefore, teams
within the organization face a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum</a>
distribution of resources. While cooperation among teams would be
efficient, competition is created in the allocation of resources.</p>
<p>As with coordination among individual bureaucrats, a source of
friction for teams is the differences in perspective based on local
conditions, having insufficient education or experience, different
incentives, or different definitions of success. Ideally each team
shares the organization's vision, but in practice local conditions
influence decision-makers.</p>
<p>When attempting to resolve friction between teams, there is an
authority common to the teams due to the hierarchical structure of
responsibilities. That person who, by position, is responsible for
resolving conflict, lacks nuanced insight, doesn't have time to get
involved in every challenge, and doesn't want to micromanage multiple
teams. The resolution is often left to the respective teams.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Two teams in an organization have a relationship, and each has data
storage and data processing capability. Allen's team sends Bob's team
data on a weekly basis. Because the teams were built for different
purposes and at different times by different people, the data storage
capabilities used by each team are not compatible. Members of Allen's
team print all the records (usually about a hundred pages) and then
delivers the paper documents to Bob's team. Members of Bob's team then
retype all the information into the data storage used by Bob's team.</p>
<p>Recently the office went paperless. Now Allen's team sends Bob's team
a set of PDF files. Member's of Bob's team type in the content from the
PDFs into the database for Bob's team. This is deemed a win for
efficiency -- no more printing of paper documents each week!</p>
<p>Why doesn't the organization common to both teams hire a data
scientist to automate the recurring data transfer? Or train the current
staff to learn to program a solution? Or create a third team that
manages a common server? Because the current staff skill set supports
printing and typing (data entry). Training someone with a new skill set
takes an investment of money, time, is an opportunity cost, and makes
them a flight risk. Hiring a data scientist is expensive. Whether the
task is feasible is uncertain from the view of Bob and his manager (they
both lack experience with the needed technology), and how long the task
will take is uncertain. Even once they create a connection, then a
person with the skill set to maintain it is needed. The cost of ongoing
maintenance and implementation is unknown.</p>
</div>
<p>The choices for resolving this friction between teams is to either
stick with the known working approach that is suboptimal and has a known
cost, or take a risk with unknown potential improvement of unknown
degree for an unknown capital and unknown ongoing cost. And if that
improvement works out, staff who were implementing the current solution
would need to find new work or learn new skills.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.7"
id="bureaucracy-as-accidental-legacy-or-essential"><span
class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Bureaucracy as Accidental,
Legacy, or Essential</h2>
<p>Essential bureaucracy is the minimum set of processes and staffing
and skills necessary to address the complexity of managing a community's
access to a <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span>. Achieving
this minimum is tricky since optimization can be with respect to
resilience to change, resilience to edge cases, staff turnover, speed
experienced by subjects, financial cost, time spent by the organization,
and the number of staff. Miss any one of those goals and the bureaucracy
is deemed inefficient.</p>
<p>Undesirable bureaucracy is categorized as either accidental or
legacy. Accidental bureaucracy arises when someone misunderstands what
is needed or when skills of the bureaucrats involved are insufficient
for the complexity a problem. Legacy bureaucracy occurs when the
situation changes but the processes do not.</p>
<p>Accidental and legacy bureaucracy accumulate within an organization.
Optimization of improved efficiency is at odds with change which
disrupts careers, relationships, and accumulated power.</p>
<p>Resolving each of these suboptimal conditions may seem easy: have
better knowledge of the problem, assign the right people to the problem,
and change processes as problems evolve. In practice the easy resolution
is challenging.</p>
<p>Having enough knowledge is often infeasible, especially for complex
problems at a large scale. Having the people with the right skills
assumes that a pipeline of people with relevant talents exists and that
people in the pipeline won't be poached to work on other challenges.
Keeping up with evolving problems depends on having resources to change
(beyond the maintenance baseline) and having a defined approach for
changing the process.</p>

<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is
bad</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: When a person subjected to bureaucracy has
a negative experience, the easiest attribution is to the
least-understood aspect -- the bureaucracy.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Bureaucracy as defined in this guide is
neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is merely a way of managing resources

<p><em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>There is no point in planning
ahead since everything (staffing, funding, purpose, scope) is always
changing.</strong><br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Change can feel disorienting, especially
when it is unexpected. A change of the assumptions for a plan may make
the plan less relevant.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Preparing for change and thinking ahead
about contingencies enables effective use of resources. Have a vision
and work towards it while accounting for and adapting to change. This
approach requires extra work, some of which will be left unused. See

who observe seemingly wasteful processes.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: If bureaucracy were truly inefficient
(not allocating resources in the most efficient way), then in a
competitive environment it would be replaced by a more efficient

<em>Why this feels true</em>: Relationships within an organization have
a half-life and require ongoing investment to renew. At the same time,
new bureaucratic processes are constantly being developed by other
bureaucrats. The number of processes increases as the organization ages.
Bureaucracy seems to arise without effort and countering it takes
effort.<br />

When you are reasoning about bureaucratic systems, there may be a
conclusion that is concise and feels explanatory. Then you should try to
come up with counter-examples, either logically or from experience.</p>
<p>Some fallacies are based on an expectation that other people should
be more like what you imagine your best self to be. That mindset fails
to account for your shortcomings and the diversity of other
bureaucrats.</p>

<p>You can read this list from a position of authority to take action,
or you can read this list as an advocate for improvement.</p>
<p>In isolation, none of these ideas should be surprising. Enacting each
idea requires ongoing investment. A champion is needed to actively
promote and support each idea.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Automate recurring decision processes. Automation
can decrease work and decrease the risk of inconsistent outcomes.
Automation is a way of encoding bureaucratic processes that involve
subjective decisions into repeatable steps.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Bureaucrats don't know how to
automate processes, or there isn't infrastructure available to support
automation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Where automation is infeasible for a process
involving multiple bureaucrats, make advocates with end-to-end authority
available to the subject. This improves the subject's experience of a
process. A benefit to the organization is that the advocate might see
opportunities for improvement not apparent to a bureaucrat responsible
for one step in the process.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: The organization may lack
incentives to provide customer advocates. When there is a customer
advocate, that person may not have the skills or time to exert
end-to-end oversight of the process.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make processes transparent to participants. This
improves the subject's understanding of a process. Transparency can help
with trustworthiness if the reasoning for actions is defensible.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Transparency requires technology
that is not central to the process. Transparency costs money that could
otherwise be spent on more central tasks in the organization.
Transparency can provide data that is then used against the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make information discoverable (e.g., via search
engine).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Technology that isn't the core
strength of the organization is a distraction from the central work and
a cost (in terms of staff and money).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make information directly available, rather than
mediated by a person.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Having to talk to a person
reinforces the importance of that person. The data owner feels needed,
and that can be emotionally rewarding. Whereas providing an API is less
personal.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: After an interaction is completed, summarize the
steps and outcome for the participant.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Writing notes takes time away from
accomplishing work. The written notes may not adequately capture
nuances.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: When a process fails the needs of a participant,
investigate the failure and improve the process.<a href="#fn34"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: A way to detect failures is needed.
Why would that exist? A goal of improvement sounds good, but what
incentive does the bureaucrat have to drive improvement?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make the goals and priorities of the organization
clear to all stakeholders. This enables accountability by allowing a
participant to point to dissonance.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Sharing goals enables
accountability.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Define measurable standards of performance, both
for individual bureaucrats and for teams. Again, accountability is a
feedback loop that needs a starting point for identifying
dissonance.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Carrying out measurements and
evaluating the results takes work.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Train bureaucrats on how to engage participants
effectively; these interactions determine the culture of an
organization.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: If training is pursued at all,
justifying domain-specific technical training is easier.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Train bureaucrats (e.g., formal education or
through mentorship).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Formal training is a cost with an
unquantified benefit. Mentorship doesn't result in promotion. The
attention of experienced mentors is a zero-sum investment that takes
away from time spent doing measurable work.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make employment desirable to people who have
desirable characteristics (e.g., educated candidates).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Hiring less expensive candidates is
easier to justify.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Enhance accountability to peers (e.g., peer review
of actions and outcomes).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Accountability is relevant if
improvement is desired and if you think your peers are in a position to
provide useful feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Look for ways to encourage organizations and
individual bureaucrats to improve and take risks rather than maintain
the status quo.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Deviating from the status quo means
taking risk. Specifically risk to incumbent power.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Decisions should be pushed down the hierarchy to
the practitioner&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2013_Marquet">(Marquet 2013)</span>.<a href="#fn35"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Power comes from decision-making.
Pushing decisions down means letting go of power.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: When making a decision requires cross-organization
interaction, form a team of practitioners.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Relying on practitioners to
coordinate takes management out of the critical path.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Supervisors should share their workload with their
team to gain practical exposure to current challenges.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: The skills a supervisor has may not
intersect with work being done by team members.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Seek feedback from process participants, then
provide status updates on the implementation of changes. This provides a
feedback loop and is a form of accountability.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Gathering feedback is an
opportunity cost for getting work done. If <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process">continual
improvement</a> isn't a basis for promotion of bureaucrats, there's no
little motive to invest effort.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Replace sequential approval chains with a
concurrent review process. Sequential approval reduces the number of
ideas reaching later approvers by filtering good ideas as well as bad
ideas. Approvers may perform independent (redundant) due diligence and
end up disagreeing.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Concurrent approval has the risk of
unnecessary work (someone says yes after someone else says no or asks
for additional justification) and likely conflict when two reviewers
disagree.</p></li>

href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">unavoidable hazards</a>. You can
leverage your improved understanding of complicated bureaucracy by
changing your behavior. In this section I provide actionable
suggestions.</p>
<p>My baseline assumptions are that you are a good person, you have the
relevant technical skills for your duties, and you are a good <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management">project
manager</a>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="characteristics-of-an-effective-bureaucrat">Characteristics of an
Effective Bureaucrat</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy is a system of distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making, so coordination is critical. Here are characteristics
to strive for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You communicate more effectively than anyone around you. This
applies to verbal and written communication, <a
href="#sec:effective-presentations">formal presentations</a> and <a
href="#sec:walk-arounds">informal interactions</a>. <em>Why this doesn't
happen by default</em>: people plateau when there is no incentive to
improve. What level of quality is good enough depends on the
situation-specific risks and costs.</p></li>
<li><p>You facilitate meetings so that productivity is noticeably
improved. This means creating and sharing an agenda, providing rules on
interaction (e.g., raising hands), taking notes, sharing notes, and
following on with assigned tasks after the meeting.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: facilitation is rarely
taught explicitly. The work of facilitation is considered secondary to
the discussion, even when the productivity of discussions is disastrous
and demoralizing.</p></li>
<li><p>You take part in meetings, whether that means actively
contributing or intentionally supporting other attendees. You leverage
relationships with other attendees.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: active participation
requires effort and exposes you to more risk than remaining
silent.</p></li>
<li><p>You invest effort in written communication (emails, text-based
chats, reports). Your writing empathizes with readers, captures relevant
context, is concise, and is clearly worded.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: writing-as-a-skill is
rarely the focus of a bureaucrat's work. Writing is seen as an
entry-level skill that doesn't require improvement. Finding examples of
clear writing in bureaucratic organizations is challenging, so you may
struggle to find role models.</p></li>
<li><p>You communicate verbally concisely and precisely. You listen and
you teach. You seek shared definitions.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: Without a feedback
mechanism motivating urgency, bureaucrats tend to pontificate.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are in-person with colleagues, you walk around and talk
with people one-on-one.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: bureaucrats interested in
"just doing the work" view professional interactions as a distraction
that decreases productivity.</p></li>
<li><p>You are <a href="#sec:professional-vulnerability">professionally
vulnerable</a>.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: Sharing stories of your
personal experiences in the organization requires coherent narratives
that the listener can learn from. That talent is not taught to all
employees in most organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>In your role as bureaucrat you leverage project management
skills: you have a vision, you make and share plans, all while building
consensus with stakeholders.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: Consensus requires knowing
who is relevant to include and then investing in relationships that
allow iterative feedback. That use of time is costly. The level of
extroversion may not be attractive to every bureaucrat.</p></li>
<li><p>You apply your negotiation skills&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1982_Cohen">(Cohen 1982)</span> that improve your
interactions and outcomes.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: bureaucrats are not taught
negotiation unless it is an explicitly named responsibility for their
role.</p></li>
<li><p>You reply quickly to incoming requests, whether that means
answering directly or acknowledging the request and providing a timeline
for when you will answer. This allows other people's tasks to either be
resolved or have a clear response about when progress can be
expected.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: The coping skills of
responding to a large number of inbound requests either grows through
experience, is learned by watching role models, or just doesn't
happen.</p></li>
<li><p>You strive for and demonstrate transparency. You share
information with stakeholders. Transparency enables coordination without
interpersonal relationships.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: Transparency endangers
incumbents. Transparency requires an ongoing investment that doesn't
contribute to addressing the primary issue. Transparency requires
empathy with subjects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The superpowers of a bureaucrat that facilitate cooperation and progress
in any organization include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You seek information from stakeholders without burdening them.
When your requests are burdensome, you acknowledge that and seek ways to
pay back (or forward) their investment.</p></li>
<li><p>You apply consistent processes (rather than being reactionary and
applying ad hoc responses).</p></li>
<li><p>You hold others (and yourself) accountable for their actions.
Accountability is created by clearly stating objectives and then
measuring results.</p></li>
<li><p>You adapt to the varying incentives and reference experiences of
those around you. Flexibility enables interactions with diverse
coworkers.</p></li>
<li><p>Your effectively multi-task or, more accurately, switch tasks.
The switch among tasks is triggered when the current task encounters an
externally-generated pause. You can <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)#Concept_and_motivation">pipeline
your activities</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You are prepared with a backlog of ideas (in writing) if someone
shows up with resources.</p></li>
<li><p>You know when to change communication channels (from text chats
to phone calls to in-person).</p></li>
<li><p>If you are dependent on someone else getting something done to
enable your progress, you can demonstrate priority by physically showing
up -- <u>presence creates priority</u>. Being physically at a person's
desk motivates that person to respond better than calling or emailing
them. Showing up where someone works and talking with them conveys how
much priority you place on the actions of the person you're talking
with.</p></li>
<li><p>You have intellectual empathy -- theory of mind for thinking
(whereas empathy refers to emotions). How to grow your intellectual
empathy: shadow peers and bosses and coworkers and
subordinates.</p></li>
<li><p>You have <span data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span>. You recognize
the deviations and exceptions that cause processes to come into
existence.</p></li>
<li><p>You avoid unintentionally neglecting tasks or requests. This
requires capturing incoming requests and then providing a response about
prioritization and status. This matters because other participants in
the organization should regard you as reliable in a positive
sense.</p></li>
<li><p>You focus on value delivery in relationships to a degree that
exceeds the scope of your formal role.</p></li>
<li><p>You have altered your job description to fit the growth you're
seeking.</p></li>
<li><p>You are willing to engage on a personal level and know
stakeholders outside their professional role.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of your tasks has a customer, a deadline, and a deliverable
artifact. You iterate towards a result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You occasionally ponder and discuss with other people introspective
questions like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How can I be successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the ways I could fail?</p></li>
<li><p>How would the organization be characterized as
successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the ways the organization can fail?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You find mentors and ask them questions like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What do you like most about your career?</p></li>
<li><p>Given a chance, what would you do differently?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you manage work/life balance?</p></li>
<li><p>What's the big challenge for our industry in the next two
years?</p></li>
<li><p>How would you tackle that challenge?</p></li>
<li><p>What advice do you have for a young person starting in this
industry? In this organization?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there mistakes to avoid?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I be successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What books would you recommend reading?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="frames-used-by-effective-bureaucrats">Frames
used by Effective Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>Being an effective bureaucrat is a mindset. I refer to these
perspectives as framing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Framing</em>: A bureaucrat can accomplish more as part of an
organization than by working alone. Being a member of an organization
means the bureaucrat's identity is subsumed into service for the
organization they are part of.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> At the same time,
bureaucracy enables the bureaucrat to amplify their presence by being
part of a larger organization. Sometimes the cost of being part of the
organization exceeds the force multiplier of working together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Framing</em>: Measuring your personal growth in a bureaucracy is
difficult due to the lack of <a
href="#sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples">feedback loops</a>. One approach
is to measure your capabilities for a specific task. If you can complete
the task in less time and with fewer resources and with less effort,
that's progress. If you can now complete a task that you previously
wanted to but weren't able to, that's progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Feelings</em>: Bureaucracy induces an emotional response in
participants because things don't work the way each person wants. This
can lead emotionally to frustration and then apathy. Understanding how
things work in a bureaucracy can help decrease the anger.</p>
<p>Another emotional response to bureaucracy is a sense of
powerlessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some third person decides your fate: this is the whole essence of
bureaucracy.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sense of powerlessness applies both to bureaucrats and to
subjects of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The sense of powerlessness is somewhat valid, in that you are as a
bureaucrat giving up some power compared to your ability to act
individually. That is the trade for working with other people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Feelings</em>: A process feels bureaucratic when there seems to be
dissonance. The subject faces a multi-step task that they can imagine
one person doing the same action in fewer steps and taking less time.
The illusion of decreased bureaucracy is created by consolidation from
the subject's perspective. The barrier to enacting consolidation is the
necessary coordination among different stakeholders who receive no
benefit from the consolidation. Externalizing the coordination to the
subject is what causes the sense of bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-be-an-effective-bureaucrat">How to be
an Effective Bureaucrat</h3>
<p>The following advice is specific to situations that you may not have
yet encountered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Work on three tasks concurrently.</strong> Don't
rely on one person or one idea for your success. On the other end of the
spectrum, don't spread yourself too thin. Working on a multitude of
projects decreases risk of any one outcome failing but also decreases
the amount of attention spent thinking about a specific challenge.</p>
<p>The three tasks should be at off-set stages (early, mid-way, and
nearing completion) rather than all being the same level of
maturity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: When you get stuck, use the following changes of
perspective: <strong>Look upstream, look downstream. Look to peers. Zoom
in (narrower scope) and zoom out (broader scope)</strong>. These are all
ways of changing the context. That change may help you identify
assumptions that are holding back progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: When you are asked to take on more work, <strong>avoid
responding with "that's not my job."</strong> If the request is
misguided and your perception is that it really is the responsibility of
another person, ask if the requester is aware of that other person's
responsibilities. If you are to take on the work, get guidance on
re-prioritizing and ensure the request is documented in writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: If there's something you want to accomplish, <strong>strive
for influence without authority</strong> instead of working to gain
control over resources (e.g., through promotion). Avoid the following:
"In this organization X is important to me, but I can't do X right now
because I don't have enough power in the organization. So I'll get
promoted and then do X."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Learn the perspectives of those around
you.</strong><br />
The relevance of knowing the paradoxes including dilemmas and
unavoidable hazards, is that you should talk explicitly to your fellow
bureaucrats about these specific topics in conversation. Not that the
goal is to find consensus or agreement. But to find what the other
person is thinking so that you can account for their processes</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Account for holistic view.</strong><br />
The specific circumstances of the challenges you face as a bureaucrat
depend on the individual people involved, what the purpose of the
bureaucracy is, what technology is available for implementation of
bureaucracy, and the resources (staffing, money, time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Learn the history of the challenge.</strong><br />
This goes beyond <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton&#39;s_fence">Chesterton's
fence</a>, which focuses on why the current approach is in place.
Learning the history of a problem means what has been tried before and
failed. How did the previous iterations evolve into the current
situation? Was the cause personalities, insufficient resources,
inadequate technology? What's changed that enables this approach to be
better? What do you know that prior attempts didn't?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>For a given challenge, work on three
remedies</strong>.<br />
One solution you're working on may fail, and another may be
inadequate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Minimize <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">external
costs</a></strong>.<br />
A solution that externalizes costs harms the greater organization and
creates bureaucratic debt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Exploit the flexibility of rules for the benefit of
all parties.</strong><br />
change the rules of the game and the objectives of the game such that
every participant wins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Align selfish interests with social
interests.</strong><br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
When a person has a positive experience engaging with bureaucracy, the
positive attribution is made to the people involved. Or the ease of a
solution makes bureaucracy less visible and the solution seems obvious.
When a person has a negative experience with bureaucracy, complaints are
about the incompetence of the people involved, or the
incomprehensibleness of the system. Don't these bureaucrats know how to
do their job? Why isn't the solution obvious? Why does this system not
work for me? David Graeber summarized this view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amongst working-class Americans, government is now generally seen as
being made up of two sorts of people: 'politicians,' who are blustering
crooks and liars but can at least occasionally be voted out of office,
and 'bureaucrats,' who are condescending elitists almost impossible to
uproot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of bureaucracy (the number of people in an organization)
and the processes of an organization can seem disproportionate to the
apparent complexity of the task. Typically when a person (being a
subject of bureaucracy) interacts with the bureaucratic organization the
artifacts are simple -- a check, a form, or a permit. The simplicity of
the artifact does not correlate to the number of decisions made, the
tracking of information, or the precautions taken. All these aspects are
invisible to the subject.</p>
<p>As an example, consider when you go to the doctor and they mend your
broken arm with a cast. That seems straightforward because all you see
is the doctor putting a cast on. You don't get insight on the decisions
they had to make. Why did they need 20 years of focused schooling to
carry out a procedure that took 15 minutes?</p>
<p>Judging bureaucracy by the artifact visible to the individual subject
under sells the complexity of the decision-making necessary to take
action. The contingencies that you were not exposed to because
everything went well make the amount of investment from the bureaucrat
appear wasteful.</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you also lack the ability to
distinguish how much work is attributable to the bureaucrat generating
justifications for their actions (colloquially, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass">covering the
bureaucrat's ass</a>).</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you typically can't distinguish when
work is caused by a bureaucrat's ill-informed decisions. Is the person
stupid, mistaken, or is there something you are not taking into account?
Sometimes the work is carried out by insufficiently trained bureaucrats,
but you don't get to know whether you're working with an experienced and
knowledgeable bureaucrat or a new untrained bureaucrat.</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you don't have visibility on the many
nuances of an organization. The internal power struggles and
organizational politics that depend on personalities, resources, and
competing prioritization are not clear to outsiders. The inconsistency
of an organization's policies may not be felt by bureaucrats in that
organization. Each bureaucrat may have a different opinion, resulting in
a lack of consistent guidance. There may be legacy policies in
effect.</p>
<p>Effective action by a bureaucratic organization is complicated by the
need for relevant information. Gathering, analyzing, and sharing that
information consistently requires bureaucratic processes. Sometimes the
organization lacks the staffing with relevant skills.</p>

class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Identifying Opportunities to
Decide<span id="sec:dilemma-trilemma"
label="sec:dilemma-trilemma"></span></h2>
<p>When a decision has two viable options (neither being best), that is
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma">dilemma</a>. The name
for a decision with three viable options is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma">trilemma</a>. This section
describes a bureaucrat's experience of operating within an organization
in terms of dilemmas and trilemmas. Instead of focusing on moral
dilemmas&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2017_Zacka">(Zacka
2017)</span> or institutional ethics, here I focus on interpersonal
relationships and the logistics of allocating your attention.</p>
<p>Dilemmas are a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning">simple way</a>
of discussing decisions. Dilemmas are a useful framing to highlight the
following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You, an individual bureaucrat, face decisions that you may not
have recognized. Failing to recognize a choice (an error by omission)
can lead to suboptimal results. The dilemmas below are generic to any
bureaucratic process and are intended to stimulate your ability to
identify decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>You face complex trade-offs in your role as a bureaucrat.
Dilemmas are intended an entry point to more nuanced reflection that is
specific to your situation. The dilemmas below are not exhaustive; this
list is merely illustrative.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use dilemmas as an entry to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind">intellectual
empathy</a> with fellow bureaucrats when you recognize they face the
same dilemmas. These dilemmas are generic to the situation and the
person facing the decisions. You now have a topic to discuss with them.
You can share your understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>You can be curious about the choice other bureaucrats select for
a given dilemma. Everyone in the organization faces these decisions, so
these dilemmas give you a topic of conversation to better understand
each bureaucrat's view.</p></li>
<li><p>When you encounter a bureaucratic process that does not feel
intuitive, you can try to understand which dilemmas the designers faced.
You need to identify relevant dilemmas to build <span
data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can identify and negotiate potential sources of friction.
Other bureaucrats may arrive at different selections for a given
dilemma, so recognizing this and discussing it can improve the
effectiveness of all involved.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dilemmas explain the inherent complexity of bureaucracy even when
bureaucrats are honest and the purpose of the organization is clear. The
point isn't that one should <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">select one of the two
options</a>. The point of recognizing a dilemma is that it is a marker
that there is a decision to be made. Once the need for a decision is
identified, the action for the bureaucrat is not to select one of the
two options. The effective bureaucrat identifies nuances, enumerates
alternatives, and talks with fellow bureaucrats about these decisions.
Rather than seeking consensus, strive for comprehension of other
people's perspective. That way you can navigate decision-making
processes more effectively.</p>
<p>The choices described below in the simplified representation of
dilemmas are intended as a starting point for introducing the decision
space relevant to individual bureaucrats. Do not accept the dilemmas
presented here as the final framing. Thinking in terms of a limited
spectrum of opportunities neglects nuances that enable more creative
approaches. Awareness of these dilemmas and trilemmas are intended to
spark creative imagination about the nuances specific to your
situation.</p>
<p>By recognizing the deficiencies of dilemmas, you can identify nuances
specific to the situation you are in. Instead of responding to the
recognition of a decision with "should I do this or that?" the better
option is to assess the complexities and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming">brainstorm</a>
multiple options. Talk with stakeholders and understand the history of
the situation before making a choice and taking action.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-dilemmas-arise-in-bureaucracy">How
Dilemmas Arise in Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The existence of dilemmas is not obvious or natural. Given a task,
the simplest response for an individual is to take action and be done.
There wasn't a decision needed.</p>
<p>If the task is more challenging then first <u>make a plan</u> and
then <u>take action</u> and be done. The source of the challenge may be
task complexity, scale, number of people effected, diversity of
stakeholders, amount of time needed, how the current task shapes future
options, or the number of collaborators. Regardless of why the task is
challenging, a dilemma has already arisen: how much time to spend
planning versus doing.</p>
<p>If the task is even more challenging, it may be useful to gather data
for the plan, then make a plan, then take action and be done. A new
dilemma arises: how much time to spend gathering data versus planning.
The previous dilemma still exists -- how much time to invest in planning
versus doing. As an alternative to the dilemma framing, how much time
should be allocated to three categories of activity?</p>
<p>But wait, how did the person in the first scenario (just do the task)
know no plan was necessary? Either it was an explicit choice or they
didn't perceive the need to decide about whether to plan. Someone else
faced with that same task might choose differently, e.g., to make a
plan. The task complexity is relative to the person's skills,
experiences, expectations about stakeholders, and potential
ramifications.</p>
<p>In this escalating sequence of increasingly challenging tasks, now
suppose the task involves you and another person. The overhead of
coordination inflicts other dilemmas. The examples of complexity arising
from coordination are identified in the list of dilemmas below, e.g. <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-manager-micromanaging"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-manager-micromanaging">4.4</a>
and <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-early-intervention"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-early-intervention">4.3</a>.</p>
<p>An independent source of friction for distributed decision-making and
distributed knowledge is when people involved in the task don't agree on
how challenging it is. The framing of the difficulty matters because it
can lead different participants to distinct conclusions about how much
time should be spent planning versus for carrying out the action. The
choice of "how complicated is the task?" shapes the team dynamics and
informs the need for hierarchical roles.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="folk-wisdom-on-decision-making">Folk Wisdom
on Decision-Making</h3>
<p>Bureaucrats, whether hired for their expertise or to provide labor,
are rarely experts on decision-making. There are multiple domains in
which <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">decision-making</a>
is studied (e.g., <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory">economics</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">mathematics</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making">psychology</a>),
but practicing bureaucrats are more likely familiar with colloquialisms
that feel descriptive. A few are provided here to give a sense of both
the conciseness (relevant for memetic propagation) and the lack of
prescriptive action in each meme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy's law</a>:
"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law">Hick's law</a>:
"Increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time
logarithmically."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's
razor</a>: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained
by stupidity."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson's
law</a>: "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its
completion."<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Law of
Triviality</a>: "People within an organization commonly or typically
give disproportionate weight to trivial issues."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart's
law</a> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
measure."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Each of these memes feel descriptive to the practicing bureaucrat. They
survive because of their self-encapsulation; no more thought needed.
There is also nothing actionable about these memes.</p>
<p>In comparison to the folk expressions above, dilemmas are intended to
be accessible to practicing bureaucrats and serve as a starting point
for reflection and discussion resulting in action. Effective action is
enabled by improved understanding of the trade-offs faced within an
organization. Rather than being reductive, the purpose of cataloging
bureaucratic dilemmas is to first point out that there is a choice. Once
the choice is recognized, look for ways to think beyond the
dichotomy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-dilemmas-oversimplify">How Dilemmas
Oversimplify</h3>
<p>Although the following concepts are presented as dilemmas and
trilemmas, these are necessarily simplifications. For example, two ways
to simplify situations into a dilemma are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with a single variable, e.g., "how much data to gather",
and force it into a binary choice "more data gathering" versus "less
data gathering."</p></li>
<li><p>Start with a complex trade-off space with many opportunities and
reduce it to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dichotomy</a>
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_thinking">zero-sum
options</a>: "more data gathering" vs "more planning." The actual
trade-space involves optimization of multiple goals, like (maximize
productivity) and (minimize unnecessary risk) and (maximize quality) and
(maximize employee satisfaction) and (minimize latency).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The over-simplifications listed below neglect both the continuous
nature of the trade-offs and the alternative creative approaches to a
specific situation.</p>
<p>Rather than waiting until the need manifests, ponder these dilemmas
prior to the pressure of real-time decision-making. Recognize dilemmas
and trilemmas and then extend your analysis beyond them by adapting to
the local conditions and specific people available to help. Dilemmas
should not be resolved by you alone. Talk with subordinates, peers,
mentors, customers, and supervisors.</p>
<p>Once a dilemma is recognized, it is easier to defer and avoid the
decision-making process.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Delaying a decision
longer than necessary ripples out along the chain of dependencies.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="dilemmas-are-not-purely-intellectual">Dilemmas are not Purely
Intellectual</h3>
<p>Decision-making is not a purely intellectual task; there is emotional
stress induced by the process. Dilemmas create cognitive dissonance for
the decision-maker. Any selection is going to have downsides, and
compromise can be suboptimal. Those burdens weigh morally on deciders
because of the consequences on other people.</p>
<p>To counter this morale weight, talk with other people about
decisions. Even if this does not alleviate the responsibility of
deciding, discussion can help you arrive at new insights.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="more-complications">More Complications</h3>
<p>Adding to the difficulty and stress, dilemmas presented here occur
concurrently and continuously. The dilemmas are inter-dependent due to
both to the common variables and the constrained resources. Selecting an
option for one dilemma alters the options available in other
dilemmas.</p>
<p>Oscillation between approaches can be caused by change of management,
accumulation of experience (dissatisfaction) with one solution, the
desire for promotion within the hierarchy (where change is presented as
progress), or a desire for cost savings (efficiency).<a href="#fn41"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>
The rate of oscillation is an indicator of the half-life of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_memory">institutional
memory for an organization</a>.</p>
<p>The dilemmas identified below for generic bureaucracy are just a
baseline. For the culture you are in and the project you're working on
and the people you're working with, there will be more dilemmas to
identify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The following sections categorize dilemmas as <a
href="#sec:personal-policy-dilemmas">personal policies</a>, policies
regarding <a href="#sec:org-dilemma">structure of the organization</a>,
and <a href="#sec:subjects-dilemmas">dilemmas raised by subjects of

organization, while the structural policies for an organization are

<p>In practice, the following decisions are unordered and are constantly
faced by the bureaucrat. As observed by Lindblom in&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="1959_Lindblom">(Lindblom 1959)</span>, this
flurry of decisions contrasts to a regularized process that might be
envisioned as optimal.</p>

</div>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-focus-vs-systemic">Dilemma of
Aperture</a> is defined in terms of scope of the challenge. An adjacent
dilemma is the question of whether to focus on short-term tasks or
long-term tasks. The right balance of how long tasks take is more
project management then bureaucratic. I try to identify a small number
of long-term tasks, then divide each into smaller (shorter) tasks. The
dependencies of the smaller tasks then determine the order of the
work.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-focus-vs-systemic">Dilemma of
Aperture</a> is not specific to bureaucracy, but commonly arises because
isolated problems rarely exist. Challenges occur as part of larger
systemic contexts. Addressing the immediate problem leaves the system
issue, and tackling system issues are more difficult and take
longer.</p>
<p>Your selection of narrow versus wide within the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-focus-vs-systemic">Dilemma of Aperture</a>
depends on what you find emotionally rewarding. Other bureaucrats may
gain emotional enjoyment from approaches to problem solving that you do
not. Finding ways to leverage that difference (rather than minimizing
it) is useful.</p>
<p>Organizations typically incentivize short-term behavior. Annual
performance reviews and quarterly feedback cycles might miss systemic
changes that take multiple years to enact. Identifying incremental
milestones is one response, though that isn't always feasible. Another
approach is to only report a subset of your activities (the ones that
yield short-term results).</p>

<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-speak-up-or-hold-back">Dilemma

manager feels insecure about results. If the employees are untrained or
unmotivated, the sense of insecurity may be reasonable.</p>
<p>Limiting <a

<p>Bureaucracy is based on subjective decision-making about policy
enforcement. The <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-notes-or-no-notes">Dilemma of
Documentation</a> is a question whether you avoid risk of accountability
or enable accountability of yourself and other bureaucrats. Having a
written record is useful when confronted with the question, "What did
you know and when did you know it?"</p>
<p>If you decide to respond to the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-notes-or-no-notes">Dilemma of
Documentation</a> by taking notes and sharing them, your coworkers get
value from your notes. Your investment saves them time and allows them
to search through old notes. As a new member of a team, this is an easy
way to provide value.</p>
<p>A limiting factor biasing a bureaucrat towards the "no documentation"
extreme is the ability to take good notes during or after conversations.
That can be limited by ability to multi-task (listen and write), or
memory of what was said, or hand-writing. Another bottleneck is the time
needed for writing notes.</p>
<p>A standard response to the idea of taking notes is, "I remember what
happened." These memories can be spotty, biased, and are verbal stories
rather than artifacts. Relying on memory to recall events doesn't work
for everyone.</p>

<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-forest-vs-trees">Dilemma of

wasteful action.</p>
<p>Coordinating with other bureaucrats magnifies the challenge. If

Effective bureaucrats default to early coordination instead of waiting

<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-forest-vs-trees">Dilemma of

apply the timescale relevant to an individual to a team or

<p>Because of the distributed nature of knowledge and decision-making in

promotion can be seen from the supervisor's view and the subordinate's
view. The <a

traverses up the <a

<p>News going up the chain of command is subject to modifications -- both
filtering and embellishment. Filtering out bad news or making the report
more grandiose can be spun as contextualization. Which outcome is
preferred depends on the specific people reading the reports. Whether to
report an update is one choice, how to spin it is another. Did the team

<p>Decision-making is foundational to bureaucracy, so gathering data to
inform decisions is crucial. There's typically insufficient time and
resources available for this work, which results in imperfect
decisions.</p>
<p>The <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little">Dilemma of
Data Quantity</a> is more nuanced than merely finding <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle">just the right
amount</a> of data. The skill is knowing which data is most relevant to
the decision, and having relationships with data owners to ease the cost
of gathering data.</p>
<p>The logistics of gathering data can be measured, but there are other
subjective aspects to account for as well. Making a decision has an
emotional toll on the decider due to the risk of failure. Also,
decisions are made in a social context, with decision-makers accounting
for the ramifications on people they have relationships with.</p>
<p>While gathering less data means less cost for the bureaucrat facing a
decision, you might imagine some accountability for bad decisions due to
inadequate data. To shield individual bureaucrats from
reputation-harming liability, a decision may require an approval chain.
That review process diffuses responsibility for decisions.</p>
<p>The <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little">Dilemma of
Gathering data</a> is distinct from the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-planning-vs-iterate">Dilemma of

information gathered, and it is feasible to have lots of data and do no

<p>Managing a shared resource requires more than just on-the-spot
decision-making. Thinking ahead to potential scenarios that effect the
shared resource is the responsibility of the bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-planning-vs-iterate">Dilemma of
Planning</a> identifies a widely applicable challenge for bureaucrats
throughout an organization (top to bottom, and on every team).
Regardless of whether you're planning your next day or the next few
years, there will be unforeseen challenges. Do those interruptions
invalidate the effort of planning?</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-planning-vs-iterate">Dilemma of
Planning</a> induces different responses for each bureaucrat, so you
will likely encounter both someone who you think plans too much and
someone who doesn't plan enough. Being exclusively reactionary can be
demoralizing, as can seeing your plans become moot.</p>
<p>Making a decision imposes a bound on how much time is available for
both gathering data and planning. More time gathering data is less time
planning. Similarly, the number of people available for data gathering
and planning is bounded, and tasking people is a zero sum choice.</p>

<p>Taking big leaps can be exciting. But you might be leaping to
failure. Small leaps are less risky, supporting an evolutionary path to
discovery.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-risk-high-vs-low">Dilemma of
Risk Tolerance</a> arises in bureaucracy because the environment around
the shared resource being managed isn't static. Change requires policies
and processes to change. Whether the change is small or large is
dependent on the risk tolerance of individual bureaucrats involved in
the decision.</p>
<p>The risk tolerance of individuals is shaped by their experience. What
you see as conventional and routine another bureaucrat would regard as
untested.</p>
<p>The bias for bureaucrats is towards smaller risks. That way if
failure does occur the bureaucrat incurs less harm to their reputation.

<p>If you try to resolve the <a

iterating towards a robust outcome, you may appear unpredictable or
unstable; see Dilemma&nbsp;<a

data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-planning-vs-iterate">4.19</a>.
This is an example of cascading dilemmas. The interplay of a creative
resolution to one dilemma can effect the solution space for other
dilemmas.</p>
<p>Regardless of where on this spectrum you are with the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-quick-methodical">Dilemma of Speed and
Accuracy</a>, someone that you depend on in the bureaucracy will take
the opposite stance. This becomes a source of friction regarding how
long tasks should take.</p>
<p>The bias for this dilemma is that most bureaucrats want to be
perceived as methodical and careful. Quick judgment is seen as
risky.</p>

<p>There is usually a large range of productivity possible for a
bureaucrat. Management has input on what is expected from bureaucrat.
The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-manager-rate-of-work">Dilemma of
Urgency</a> reflects the trade-off of how much to push employees of an
organization. The <a

href="#table:dilemma-personal-work-extra-or-work-as-expected">Dilemma of
Working extra hard</a> is the view of the bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Because of weak feedback loops in bureaucratic organizations,
bureaucrats default to a relaxed work environment. Examples of
exceptions to this include seasonal variations like tax collection time
for the <a

and demand spikes like a natural disaster for <a

<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-org-inhouse-vs-external">Dilemma of
Services</a> isn't unique to bureaucracy. It applies to businesses in a
market and to governments in a global environment. Externalized services
may be cheaper, but the long-term consequence is the loss of in-house
expertise.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats making decisions about shared resources benefit from
personal experience gained from working on specific challenges. When
services are outsourced, oversight doesn't provide insight on the
nuances of the issue.</p>
<p>Teams in a bureaucratic organization that work on aspects not
critical management of the shared resource will earn less of the glory
and be seen as a cost. Because efficiency is sought, organizations
benefit from outsourcing non-core activities to other organizations that
specialize in the domain.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-org-inhouse-vs-external">Dilemma of

<p>Bureaucratic organizations are comprised of teams that provide
services to other members of the organization and to subjects. A
centralized approach improves efficiency through less redundancy, but
also can decrease responsiveness. Grove&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove 1995)</span> calls the centralized model
functional teams.</p>
<p>Centralization is often carried out for the purposes of cost
efficiency. The cost savings are due to de-duplication and having less
slack. Both of those "savings" are a decrease of redundancy, which has a
cost when there are unexpected fluctuations in need.</p>
<p>Another motive for centralization is to concentrate talent within the
organization. This can have the unintentional result of silo'ing talent
and isolating experts from the people they want to help.</p>
<p>Decentralized manifests as cross-functional teams. Do the compliance
officers or financial people or IT support staff work directly on your
team locally or are they in a separate team?</p>
<p>Rate of change between centralized and decentralized may be a
function of turnover or promotion rates.</p>
<p>A matrixed organization&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1985_NASA">(Mulligan 1985)</span> mixes the centralized
approach and cross-functional team.</p>
<p>Centralization is an intentional monopolization, with the
corresponding decrease in choices. Centralization (de-localization) can
decrease the value assigned to feedback from people using the service
because personal relations are de-valued.</p>
<p>The weaker feedback, lack of redundancy, and decreased emphasis on
relationships motivates the creation of local services.</p>

<p>Bureaucrats with direct exposure to a challenge and the ramifications
are better positioned to make decisions. As Marquet&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="2013_Marquet">(Marquet 2013)</span> points
out, pushing decisions down improves the sense of ownership. However,
people directly working on a challenge may lack a holistic perspective
held by bureaucrats higher in the chain of command.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-org-decisions-low-vs-high">Dilemma of
Decision Height</a> indicates that no individual is ideally positioned
to make decisions. Bureaucracy involves distributed decision-making
because no member has all the relevant information. The coordination of
distributed knowledge is a remedy that requires ongoing investment.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-org-decisions-low-vs-high">Dilemma of
Decision height</a> indicates that relationships up and down the chain
of command are necessary. Low-level bureaucrats need to understand the
holistic perspective, and bureaucrats at the top of the organization
need to understand the ramifications of their decisions.</p>
<p>Relationships rarely span the chain of command, and bureaucrats make
decisions based on locally accessible information and personal
experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Trilemma</em>: <strong>Do you support the cutting edge, most of the
middle, or the laggards?</strong><br />
For any given aspect of bureaucracy there is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">bell curve</a>
of skills and interest of bureaucrats. In your role of bureaucrat you
face a choice: find and collaborate with and enable the best and
brightest, or aim your efforts at the massive mediocre middle (most
bureaucrats), or try to get the dumbest bureaucrats up to speed?</p>
<p>Trying to escape the trilemma by claiming that you treat everyone
equally means you are disregarding the needs of the tail of the
distribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Trilemma</em>: <strong>Do you work for your team, your manager, or
yourself?</strong><br />
Being a member of a team that operates within a hierarchy is tough. One
reason is the question of who you are working for. The trilemma is
whether you work for yourself, work for your supervisor, or work for
your team. Ideally you can find ways to do all three, but that is not
always the case.</p>
<p>Members of the team should work collaboratively, but there is a
potential counter-force: accountability to the supervisor. Because each
team member is accountable to their supervisor(s), that motivates the
action of the individual. The team does not actually have autonomy --
they are accountable to the boss.</p>
<p>In the approach "team members are directed by their supervisor," the
synergy of the team is neglected and the supervisor becomes a bottleneck
(for decision-making and for creativity and for planning).</p>
<p>The third approach is for a person to ignore their team and their
supervisor. This might enable quicker progress, at the risk of going in
an unhelpful direction or not leveraging skills of coworkers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Trilemma</em>: <strong>Seek less budget, same, or larger
budget.</strong> Less budget is needed if you improved efficiency, but
then the proportional power within the organization is decreased. A
larger budget may be due to inefficiency or growth. Keeping the same
budget indicates no promotions are relevant (although a steady state
could result from a combination of growth and improved efficency).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A trilemma applicable to many situations is that options are
<strong>fast, inexpensive, good; choose two</strong>. (This is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">Project
management triangle</a>.)<br />
In other words, the options are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Good and fast is expensive (i.e., requires lots of
resources).</p></li>
<li><p>Good and inexpensive takes a long time (i.e., find a clever
solution).</p></li>
<li><p>Fast and inexpensive will be low quality.</p></li>

<p>The origin of the <a

(consistency means everything is the same) or equity (consistency

</div>
</div>
<p>Whenever there is a desire for lower cost and some feature there is a
tension with the costly feature. Bureaucrats make subjective decisions,
so transparency helps other people understand the reasoning behind
outcomes. Transparency is not free, so a dilemma occurs.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-subject-transparency">Dilemma of
transparency</a> depends on your role. If you are a decision-maker or
data owner, you do not gain immediate value from justifying decisions or
sharing data. You pay a cost to provide transparency, both reputational
(your mistakes become visible) and financial (for hosting data, time
spent publishing). There are potential benefits to transparency --
improved trust in relationships, subjects detecting and reporting
mistakes.</p>
<p>An incumbent bureaucrat defaults to no transparency. If subjects want
to dispute decisions they benefit from having information about how the
policy was applied. If the subject is willing to pay the cost for the
data, then the decision-maker has to do extra work to make data
available.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"

<p>There are many dilemmas listed above but the list is not
comprehensive. Even if each bureaucrat considers the same choices (which
doesn't necessarily happen), not everyone makes the same selection.</p>

decisions would improve consistency, this would be <a

class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Unavoidable Hazards of
Bureaucracy<span id="sec:unavoidable-hazards"
label="sec:unavoidable-hazards"></span></h2>
<p>In a bureaucracy there are certain challenges that cannot be avoided.
The value of recognizing them is to understand that what you're
experiencing isn't an anomaly. The problem isn't unique to you, your
circumstances, your coworkers, or the organization. The cause is the
combination of all those factors.</p>
<p>Good ideas are not enough for adoption or continuation. Concepts
critical to the success of the organization do not need to continue.
Emotional fortitude is critical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Separation of responsibility and
accountability</strong>.<br />
Each bureaucrat in an organization has responsibilities associated with
their role. The ability to complete the tasks associated the role are
not wholly within the scope of the bureaucrat's control. You are
dependent on other bureaucrats. Even if there is a desire for action,
the action might not be immediately feasible because of a dependence on
another person or process.</p>
<p>The consequence of separation of responsibility from authority is
that other people look incompetent or lazy and unresponsive.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Perception matters more than
intent</strong>.<br />
You may mean to convey a specific message, but the way your listeners
hear that content or read the message depends on context and
interpretation. Decreasing the ambiguity in phrasing is a useful
investment, but you don't control how an audience responds.</p>
<p>Communication is crucial for bureaucracy, so the best response is
iterating with an audience rather than expecting a single message to be
sufficient.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Appreciation for being an effective
bureaucrat is rare.</strong><br />
If you do your job well no one will notice. This is because of an
expectation of smooth and fast interactions. Frictionless engagement is
expected even if that is not the norm.</p>
<p>Consider teachers who catch cheating students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No one [thanks teachers] for policing cheating. Not the cheaters,
not the honest students who feel inconvenienced and mistrusted, and
certainly not the school [administrators] who have to process academic
dishonesty paperwork."<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This same concept applies to any bureaucrat. The number of thank you
cards sent to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug
Administration</a> meat inspectors keeping food safe, <a
href="https://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and Health
Administration</a> regulators ensuring a safe work environment, <a
href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a>
detecting disruptive electromagnetic signals, <a
href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, and <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> is
likely small.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>There are counter examples in public service bureaucracy. Law
enforcement is thanked when there is a victim of a crime. The military
is held in high regard. In both of those bureaucracies the bureaucrats
are visible and the consequence of their work is tangible.</p>
<p>In large organizations there are teams of bureaucrats like the
Information technology department and human resources. IT support
bureaucrats are occasionally thanked by their subjects, though most of
the time the expectation is that computers should just work. HR produces
no tangible products, so the appreciation is lower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Lack of accountability to fellow bureaucrats
who rely on you.</strong><br />
You are more likely to feel accountable to your supervisor. Performing
for your supervisor and explaining your value matters more than the work
done to support coworkers. This also applies when you depend on other
people -- they aren't accountable to you.</p>
<p>To counter this tendency, build personal relationships with peers.
This requires ongoing investment, both to maintain relationships and to
create bonds with new coworkers as your previous coworkers leave.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Decision-makers are under-informed and
inexperienced.</strong><br />
You can make a decision with insufficient information. There is rarely
an expectation of expertise or experience. Gathering information takes
time and is thus burdensome. Having experience requires getting
experience -- you either start as a novice and make mistakes, have formal
academic training, or rely on mentorship to avoid direct experience of
mistakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Gathering data for decisions takes resources
and expertise.</strong><br />
When there is a desire to gather data, and there is data available to be
gathered, an investment of time is necessary. Well-informed decisions
take time, experience, or both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Defining success is subjective and
dynamic</strong>.<br />
Who defines success and for which audience in a bureaucratic
organization is subjective because of the lack of feedback mechanisms.
Consequences may not be immediately obvious. Worse, how success is
defined can be changed at any time -- there's no need for
consistency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Change threatens incumbents</strong>.<br />
Change of plans, roles, tasks, resources, flatness of org, scope,
technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility">Diffusion
of responsibility</a> in the bureaucracy</strong>.<br />
A specific task needs to be completed, and action requires involvement
of multiple collaborators.</p>

building manager, an electrical substation operator, and an electrical
grid operator.</p>

<p>An office worker wants to plug in a toaster oven in the office
kitchen (see figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:toaster_oven"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:toaster_oven">4.5</a>).
The owner of the toaster oven files a notice with the office manager who
tracks electrical loads in the kitchen. The toaster owner uses the power
number (1200 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt">Watts</a>)
from the manufacturer's website. In practice the toast oven doesn't
actually use that much power, that's just the maximum rating for the
device.</p>
<p>The office manager aggregates power from the devices in the kitchen.
The office manager has a power budget for the team's kitchen equipment
and keeps a margin of 10% spare capacity for flexibility. The office
manager's power budget is provided to the building manager (who keeps a
margin of 10% for flexibility). The building is one of many sharing the
electrical substation. The electrical substation owner sees the power
consumption is below the rated capacity but the subscription for
available power is full -- no new users can be supported.</p>
</div>
<p>Lesson: in a system of aggregated layers, each person only sees
adjacent layers. When each person builds in safety into their budget,
the accumulated slack is excessive and is wasteful.</p>
<p>Similar situations arise for temporal planning (schedule), financial
budgets, and spatial planning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Diffusion of blame in the
bureaucracy</strong>.<br />
Example: if something goes wrong, who is at fault: the creator of a
policy or the person tasked with executing the policy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>High latency feedback</strong>.<br />
See <a href="#sec:slowing-communication">slow communication</a> and <a
href="#sec:decision-delay">decision delay</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Weak feedback</strong>.<br />
Suppose my bureaucratic task depends on a service provided by you, a
fellow bureaucrat. If your computer isn't working, your ability to
provide the service is blocked by a dependency on a computer repair
person. You might feel relieved -- you can relax while you wait on the
computer repair and you don't have to do work providing the service to
me. You might feel anxious -- you're unable to provide the service until
the computer is fixed. Regardless of how you feel about the situation,
my task is blocked. If neither you nor I have priority relative to the
computer repair person's other tasks, then we wait. This question of
priority could be resolved hierarchically (for which there is limited
attention bandwidth) or socially (dependent on someone having a
relationship with the repair person).</p>
<p>The delay for my task may be sufficiently small that raising the
issue through the hierarchy or socially is not a good use of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The person making the rules that you follow
doesn't actually know what they're doing</strong>.<br />
Your choices then include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow the rules that are not correct. This harms your
productivity and morale.</p></li>
<li><p>You can violate the rules and be more effective. This puts you at
risk for sanctions.</p></li>
<li><p>You can work the change the rules. Then you are not doing the
work that's needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>You rarely get to pick who is on the
team</strong>.<br />
When a task requires collaboration, there is rarely a choice of who you
get to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>You rarely get to alter team
membership.</strong><br />
As a team member, you typically get little input on who you work with.
Even as a manager your options for hiring are often limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Fear of the unknown.</strong><br />
Current suffering is tolerable compared to the uncertainty of change,
especially when the suffering isn't felt by the decision-maker.</p>
<p>By identifying this fear in yourself or those you collaborate with,
you can discuss specific concerns and work to address them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Fear of change.</strong><br />
Change disrupts the status quo, putting accumulated power at risk and
altering relationships.</p>
</div>
<p>An emotional basis for decision-making (or avoidance of
decision-making) may or may not be rational. Discussing the fear with
fellow bureaucrats can ease the burden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Fear of conflict.</strong><br />
Refers to conflict of ideas, not physical conflict. Conflict of ideas is
not personal, though the consequences may have impacts on careers for
stakeholders.<br />
Professional disagreement is to be expected in a bureaucratic
organization.</p>
<p>Feeling uncomfortable is distinct from feeling unsafe. Communicating
while feeling discomfort is a useful skill, rather than avoidance. You
can demonstrate courage by talking about your sense of discomfort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Inadequate resources: staffing, time,
money.</strong><br />
The resources you have to address a challenge may not match the
complexity of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Outcomes for the team are ill-defined and
constantly shifting.</strong><br />
Most bureaucrats rely on approaches that assume consistency of their
environment. Planning for uncertainty and change is more
complicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The reward for good work is more
work.</strong><br />
When a coworker doesn't do their fair share, then the productive
employee shoulders more burden. The deficient worker has no incentive to
improve</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The organization has a lack of vision; or has
vision but no plan; or has vision and a plan but no consensus; or has
vision and a plan and consensus but inadequate resources.</strong><br />
An organization of bureaucrats can operate without a vision or plan or
sufficient resources. Being busy is easy, being productive is hard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Progress depends on subjective
decision-making.</strong><br />
Rarely is the optimal path deterministic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Easier to ask for big money than small
money.</strong><br />
Processes are scale invariant. Regardless of whether you're asking for
$1000 or $100,000, the process is the same. Accountability processes for
large amounts of money are not scaled down to fit small amounts because
people can be as dumb with $100 as they are with $10,000.</p>
<p>People problems are invariant of where in the hierarchy the problems
occur. Less attention is paid to the same problem at the lowest levels
as compared to higher in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Flux of people and processes.</strong><br />
Sources of flux include staff turn-over, changing conditions, changing
timelines, change of vision, and the need to be promoted. In a
bureaucracy, consistency doesn't yield promotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Why are there so many rules?</strong><br />
To address edge cases and malicious or dumb people. See the <a
href="#table:dilemma-subject-forms">Dilemma of Forms</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>So much paperwork or forms.</strong> Why is red
tape endemic to bureaucracy?<br />
Paperwork as a form of coordination in processes to facilitate
decentralized decision-making.</p>
<p>One of the motives for paperwork is to catch people who are
misrepresenting their intent, whether accidental or intentional.
Documentation makes prosecution more straightforward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Everything is slower.</strong><br />
What the person saying this means is "slower than desired for what I
need" or "slower than I imagined in my simplified model."</p>
<p>Progress is slower than expected because there aren't as many hours
available as na&#xEF;vely imagined. In a bureaucracy the actual time spent
working is less than the number of hours you get paid for. Breaks taken
during work, vacation from work, holidays, and sick leave are
illustrated in figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:hours_per_year"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:hours_per_year">4.6</a>.
An additional factor is that the people you depend on do not work
exclusively on your request -- there are competing investments of
attention.</p>
<p>Developing <span data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span> means having a
more detailed model that accounts for the cost of coordination and
accounts for their being less time available than the na&#xEF;ve
expectation.</p>

<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy inhibits
creativity.</strong><br />
See notes on <a href="#sec:innovation">innovation</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy grows.</strong><br />
The causes of growth include scope creep, an increased number of people
participating in the process, an increased workload, or the ratio of
workers to managers decreases.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy grows because some people lie. The progress is called
"improved accountability" because we aren't sure who the next liar is
going to be. More work is created for everyone because we don't want to
confront the liars and cheats.</p>
<p>You can measure the growth of bureaucracy using metrics like the
latency in addressing a request and the number of people involved in
addressing a request.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing the size of a bureaucracy is easier than cutting
it down.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The larger a hierarchy, the ratio of workers to
managers gets worse</strong>.<br />
As complexity and workload increase, the number of staff needed
increase. To facilitate coordination, managers arise. The amount of work
being done in a bureaucracy can be small compared to the number of
participants.</p>
<p>In figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:growth_of_bureaucracy"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:growth_of_bureaucracy">4.7</a>a, the ratio of
workers to participants is 3:3=1. When a manager is added, the ratio is
3:4 = 0.75 (a lower value means less apparent work per employee is being
done). Adding a second team with dedicated management puts the ratio at
6:9=0.66. Finally, with a dedicated administrative team (e.g., payroll,
hiring, facilities), the ratio is 6:13=0.46.</p>
<p>Adding more people to a hierarchical organization results in
diminishing returns for time spent on the central work since bureaucrats
invest time maintaining the hierarchy and administrative processes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Each person in a bureaucracy has multiple
roles</strong>.<br />
To limit the expansion of the bureaucracy. The multiple roles come from
multiple relationships necessary to span an organization larger than <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's
number</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Everything is more
complicated</strong>.<br />
Bureaucracy administers access to resources, whether tangible items
(water, air) or expertise. There's friction for tangible resources
because the easiest solution is you get the resource (without an
intermediary). There's friction for expertise because the expert
understands things you do not.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is inefficient and
wasteful.</strong><br />
The inefficiency of an organization is not just due to a breakdown of
communication among its many members. Other sources include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Individuals in different roles face distinct external incentives
which drive a diversity of investments. Work that is not aligned results
in wasted effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants have a different views of what constitutes a problem
and which problem is most relevant. Coordinating to resolve
disagreements appears inefficient regardless of which metric is used to
measure efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>Within the organization there can competition for resources.
Competition leads to wasted effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Because decisions by bureaucrats are subjective, there is
significant risk of being wrong or being called out by others as being
wrong. The incentive to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass"> cover your
ass</a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> exists for decisions. As a result,
unnecessary work is carried out to limit blame.</p></li>
<li><p>Situations and constraints change faster than the time it takes
to complete a task. Then you are faced with either continuing under the
initial assumptions or pivoting a project partway through. If an
objective quantitative measure of value is available, the return on
investment could be determined.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Efficiency is typically assessed from the perspective of a serial
process -- a single worker could do this task faster, so why involve ten
people and get a slower, more burdensome result? Specialization of
skills, resilience, validation checks, and increased throughput all
motivate the addition of bureaucrats to processes.</p>
<p>Brook's Mythical Man Month&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1975_brooks">(Brooks 1975)</span> points out that dividing a
task among ten people does not make the task finish in a tenth of the
time. There is overhead of coordination and the training of new members
who are intended to help.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's
law</a> is the quantification that a task which takes one person one
hour is unlikely to scale to ten people accomplishing ten results in one
hour. The consequence is that you can't evaluate what should be
considered wasteful by considering a single person's throughput and then
multiplying by the number of people on a team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Scope creep.</strong><span
id="sec:scope-creep" label="sec:scope-creep"></span><br />
Scope creep can originate from three sources: the bureaucrat doing the
work, the customer of the bureaucrat's work, and the bureaucrat
management. In the first situation, the person doing the work might see
a nearby opportunity that only requires a little be more work.</p>
</div>
<p>When the customer is the source of scope creep, the root cause is
that customer wants more. While the exploration of what's possible can
be exciting (a positive experience), what the bureaucrat hears is more
work and delayed results. This implies a few trade-off options, all of
which are negative for one or both parties.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stick with the original terms (telling the customer "no", which
is negative for both parties).</p></li>
<li><p>Re-negotiation for more time (a burden to both parties).</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat doing more for the same pay, which means less
money per effort (yielding a less happy bureaucrat).</p></li>
<li><p>Decreasing existing efforts to fit the added requirements
(yielding a less happy customer).</p></li>
<li><p>Even if the bureaucrat is getting paid by the hour, more work
means the end product will be delayed to accommodate added features
(yielding a less happy customer).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The third source of scope creep is from management. Executive
decision-makers tried to make decisions without having the full context
of the impacts of the decisions. Lower level people doing things see
opportunities and extend their scope incorrectly because they don't have
the full picture. In both these cases, the problem is that the person
doesn't know what they don't know and trying to solve problems outside
of their knowledge. How would that person know that they don't know? The
easy answer to this is if you are in a position of authority, check
downward before making a pronouncement. If you are in a position of
execution, check upward before taking action. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military)#Commander&#39;s_intent">Commander's
intent</a> works in both directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Migrating technologies.</strong><br />
The person enacting the transition has to be educated in both the old
and new technology. The legacy code has to be migrated to the new
implementation convincing stakeholders; may require synchronization

<p>This section focuses on an individual bureaucrat operating within an
organization. What actions can you take? This chapter is a prelude to
the next chapter, <a href="#sec:working-with-other-bureaucrats">working
with others</a>.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, understanding your options for action matters. If
you don't know what your options are, you're less effective. If you are
ok with being ineffective, or are not feeling the harm of your
ineffectiveness, keep in mind that there is no neutral member of a
bureaucracy. Either you are contributing to the organization, or you are
sapping resources from the organization. This dichotomy exists because
the organization operates in a zero-sum game for resource
allocation.</p>
<p>Voluntary membership in a long-lasting organization implies a
turnover rate. Organizations constantly have to onboard new members just
to maintain a constant level of membership.</p>
<p>An organization is distinct from the rest of society due to the
differences in norms and goals. If an organization does not invest in
onboarding, the norms of wider society will prevail and the organization
will cease to be distinguishable from society.</p>
<p>I discuss <a href="#sec:hiring">hiring</a> from both the perspective
of the person hiring and the person being hired. I describe incentives

person's experience.</p>

class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Hiring into a Bureaucracy<span
id="sec:hiring" label="sec:hiring"></span></h2>
<p>Hiring shapes the culture of an organization and determines what is
feasible, both by the skills of those hired and how well new hires
integrate with the existing organization.</p>
<p>Hiring is an expensive process in terms of money, time, emotional
investment of candidates, and the burden of reviewing applicants. As a
candidate, recognize the risk the organization is taking. As a reviewer
of candidates, this is an investment in the future of the organization.
Even if your bureaucratic role does not require an exclusive focus on
hiring, there is value in studying this domain.</p>
<p>When hiring into an organization there is a selection bias in the
people who join a bureaucracy, and there is a selection bias who stays
in bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specifics of the job, there are specific attributes
that make a candidate more likely to be successful in a bureaucracy. In
addition to role-specific skills, hire for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>,
social skills, and intrinsic motivation.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.2" id="tips-for-getting-started"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Tips for Getting Started</h2>
<p>You may have graduated from school with a degree in a specific
subject. Then you go to work and expect the position you're in to apply
the domain-specific education you have at work. That work produces an
outcome and gives meaning to the struggle of educational process (time,
money, effort). When you are not allowed to practice what you went to
school for the disconnect may feel dissatisfying.</p>
<p>An alternative attitude is that you went to school to learn how to
learn. A degree represents your ability to learn and persist, rather
than a domain specialization. Then, when you get to work, you are
presented with new opportunities to learn other domains.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="onboarding-into-a-bureaucratic-organization">Onboarding into a
Bureaucratic Organization</h3>
<p>There are two parties in hiring. Responsibility for successful
integration relies on both parties actively working together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As the new hire, make an effort to learn the names of those around
you.<br />
As the hirer, make introductions. Not just the first time, but for the
first week or two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As the new hire, learn the jargon.<br />
As the hirer, explicitly expand jargon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As the new hire, seek one-on-ones.<br />
As the hirer, offer one-on-ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As the new hire, write documentation on processes.<br />
As the hirer, provide documentation on processes.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-orient-yourself">How to Orient
Yourself</h3>
<p>Sometimes your role as a bureaucrat may be poorly defined. The lack
of direction or objectives may be feel disappointing or frustrating. The
positive perspective is that you get to define your tasks and determine
what would be useful or interesting.</p>
<p>Two mentalities that I find useful are enabling others and working
myself out of the job. My goal is to facilitate success rather than
being integral to the process. Enabling other people to be successful
can apply to customers, fellow bureaucrats, or management. Not everyone
matters equally, so figuring out the relevance of helping specific
people impacts your decision.</p>
<p>Another tactic I use is to look around, look backwards, and look
forward. What are the challenges my team or my organization faces? Then
review previous attempts to address the challenges. Why did previous
efforts fail to remedy the situation? Once I have a less na&#xEF;ve view and
more context, what is my vision of the desired scenario? Without this
vision there is a danger of doing work that keeps me busy but yields no
progress.</p>
<p>The tactics of identifying challenges and learning the history of a
challenge often relies on social interactions. A bureaucratic
organization rarely maintains a searchable written record of decisions
and failed efforts. If that content is available, it may lack the
specificity available from oral narrative by people who were present.
When investigating issues in a bureaucracy, I end discovery-oriented
conversations with the question, "Who else should I talk to about this
issue?" Independent of the content or the quality of the content, this
question is the entry point to a large second-order social network of
expertise that is often separate from the hierarchical chain of command.
If multiple separate discussions lead to the same person, then that
person is key.</p>
<p>Documenting your process as you proceed helps both your
self-reflection and your ability to measure progress. Written
documentation of your status can be used as proactive updates to your
management and provides a record when someone asks retroactively why you
took certain actions.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic challenges that do not violate the constraints of Nature
(such as conservation of momentum, conservation of mass, speed of light,
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg
Uncertainty principle</a>) are solvable. There are typically political,
social, personality, security, and technical aspects that need to be
accounted for. Laws can be changed, regulations altered, people
replaced, and norms updated. Constraints that appear to be logically
inconsistent may be re-framed to be resolved. Narrowing or broadening
the scope may reset the context for a challenge.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.3" id="setting-your-emotional-state"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Setting Your Emotional
State</h2>
<p>As a member of a bureaucratic organization, you may feel the
frustration of bureaucracy, the happiness of success, the excitement of
possibilities, or the fear of uncertainty of operating in a complicated
environment. Your emotional state, whether set by your work or set by
events outside the bureaucracy, impacts your productivity and the
well-being of your coworkers.</p>
<p>You may see emotions as getting in the way of productivity and
creating problems, or emotions as unprofessional. This view is not
shared by everyone, and there are real benefits to feelings like
passion, enthusiasm, excitement, and joy. Yes, joy can be felt by
bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Expecting bureaucrats to be apply cold rational logic to decisions
and interactions is unrealistic. Openness to engaging emotional is more
constructive than avoiding or suppressing emotional aspects of the
job.</p>
<p>One source of emotions inspired by bureaucracy is when your roles,
responsibilities, and resources do not align. You want to be effective
and feel frustrated. This frustration can infect your interactions with
coworkers.</p>
<p>Another source of emotions in a bureaucratic organization is when you
see someone else making what appears to be a poor decision or policy. If
you lack the ability to alter the decision or influence the policy, this
can feel disheartening or demoralizing. Worse, these policies outside
your control may impact you.</p>
<p>A third set of emotions in bureaucratic interactions occurs when a
group of bureaucrats with distinct perspectives, strong opinions, and
diverse experiences faced with complex challenges have insufficient time
to create consensus and select the optimal choice. Stress felt by each
participant impacts the interaction.</p>
<p>The relevance of these emotional states is that frustration and
stress can decrease your capacity for effective communication. Happier
bureaucrats can be more productive and collaborative.</p>
<p>By identifying these emotional patterns, the situation can seem less
personal. Your feelings are legitimate, but they are not unique to you.
Anyone in that situation is likely to feel similarly. Realizing this
helps build empathy instead of ignoring the feeling.</p>

class="header-section-number">5.3.0.1</span> Organization chart
orientation <span id="sec:org-chart-orientation"
label="sec:org-chart-orientation"></span></h4>
<p>A common method of describing relations within the bureaucracy is the
organization chart (colloquially, the "<span
data-acronym-label="org chart" data-acronym-form="singular+short">org
chart</span>"). Normally the CEO is at the top of the chart, middle
management is in the middle, and managed employees are at the bottom.
See figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top">5.1</a>.</p>
<p>An organization's culture is subtly conveyed by artifacts like org
charts. There are emotional connotations to alternative layouts. You can
alter expected relations (culture and norms) by playing with orientation
of the org chart. Org chart orientation can be overanalyzed, so this
exploration is limited.</p>
<p>The point of thinking about org chart orientation is to frame how you
perceive your supervisors, peers, subordinates. Notice that the framing
is embedded in the words -- prefixes super (over) and sub (under). These
concepts inform what you expect from relations. Do I seek support or
direction and guidance from my boss? What do I expect from my boss,
peers subordinates? What do I expect to provide them?</p>
<p>The relative orientation of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> to
workers sets expectations for relations. Options for orientation are the
conventional CEO at top (figure&nbsp;<a

id="sec:learn-from-failure" label="sec:learn-from-failure"></span></h2>
<p>This section on individual failure is separate from <a
href="#sec:org-failure-and-success">how an organization characterizes
failure</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Making progress in a bureaucracy is not a linear sequence of steps.
Ideally there is an ongoing cycle of trying something, not succeeding,
and then applying what you learn towards the next try. This idealized
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast#Business">fail
fast</a>" cycle does not occur naturally -- the participants have to
either have intrinsic motivation or external incentives to make
progress. Failing as a path for learning is justified after having
exhausted less expensive alternative education opportunities like
reading books, going to school, and talking with experts.</p>
<p>The recognition of failure depends on a clear measurement. Do the
participants know the measure, and are they able to make the
measurement? Having a defined measure of failure and regularly making
the measurement relies on having an understanding of the expectations
for the situation. Expectations are assumptions about the future.</p>
<p>Assumptions about the future can be categorized as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Opinions. For example, interpretation of policy. Policy
interpretation can be bent or exceptions can be made.</p></li>
<li><p>Guesses; more formally interpolation -- given multiple options,
this seems most likely.</p></li>
<li><p>Experience; more formally extrapolation -- last time this
happened, so next time ...</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Failure with respect to expectations imply thinking about the future
so that you can measure your progress (or failure). That is a subset of
planning. You can fail if you don't plan, and you can fail if you do
plan. This does not indicate that planning is irrelevant. Plans can be
overly detailed and prescriptive, or plans can be inadequately
specified; both are unhelpful.</p>
<p>If your measurements indicate failure, this could be due to an
invalid assumption (with a valid objective) or you may have selected a
bad objective. Declaring failure means re-evaluating assumptions,
resetting objectives, or giving up on the concept and doing something
else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
There are ways to avoid failing: by not setting an objective, or setting
an objective that isn't measurable. You can avoid the appearance of
failure by not telling anyone the objective. Extrinsic accountability
for failure requires other people to have awareness. If these tactics
are being employed, it may be because the person (or <a
href="#sec:org-failure-and-success">the organization</a>) doesn't want
to share how they've failed until they have a success.</p>
<p>Understanding rationales like the failure avoidance mentality is
critical if you want to avoid feeling baffled the first time you
encounter it. By learning these bureaucratic anti-patterns, you can
inoculate yourself emotionally and cognitively. You now have a chance to
think ahead before encountering the explanation.</p>
<p>A counterargument when you hear that someone is avoiding failure is
to explain that noticing failure is essential to improving. Detecting
indicators of failure, addressing the cause, and then changing is the
process of improvement. When someone wants to avoid failure, I don't
understand how they expect to improve.</p>

class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Success (and failure) in Your
Organization<span id="sec:org-failure-and-success"
label="sec:org-failure-and-success"></span></h2>
<p>This section on how a team or organization conceptualizes failure is
separate from <a href="#sec:learn-from-failure">learning from
failure</a> as an individual bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Understanding the ways your organization succeeds or fails matters to
you because it affects how you are evaluated and how you feel about your
work. Success and failure are measured against a quantitative
objective.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations have varying definitions of success and
failure because organizations are made up of individual bureaucrats with
a multitude of motives and weak feedback mechanisms. There are a few
macro-level patterns for organizations. Each pattern has affect on the
individual bureaucrats operating within the organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A bureaucratic organization that provides infrastructure service (such
as public water utility, electrical power company, or an organization's
internal computer support) has a specific failure mode. When
infrastructure is unavailable or degraded, that's a failure. Success
means satisfactory operation at minimal cost. An organization operating
in this context is motivated to avoid failure. Success is merely a lack
of failure. An effort to improve processes or otherwise innovate will
face the inertia of a culture organized around avoiding failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A bureaucratic organization that claims "wins" but no failures (because
either more or different work needed) is difficult to be productive in
when the successful outcome has ill-defined value. The success can be
counted (number of wins), but the relative importance of the success is
unclear.</p>
<p>Examples of a win-focused organization include law enforcement,
research teams, and teams with a responsibility for innovation.</p>
<p>The funding for an organization focused on "wins" depends on how well
these successes can be sold as a narrative. This biases the organization
to focus on investments most likely to get more funding. Have the
funding organization is separate from the consumer of the "wins" yields
outcomes not helpful to the consumer.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.6" id="promotion"><span
class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Promotion<span
id="sec:promotion" label="sec:promotion"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucrats get promoted for a variety of reasons: due to their
technical competence, a role needs to be filled, to motivate retention,
or for their managerial ability. Not being promoted can feel like a
slight against any of those reasons.</p>
<p>In this section, folk wisdom illustrates the frustration bureaucrats
have with promotion. The purpose of you being familiar with these
sentiments is to understand that the failures of promotion are not
specific to the team you are on or the organization you are a member of.
The deficiencies are generic to hierarchy. With this insight, you can
choose a more emotionally-healthy response to the situation.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="folk-wisdom-about-promotion">Folk Wisdom
about Promotion</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_principle">Dilbert
principle</a> says organizations "Systematically promote incompetent
employees to management to get them out of the workflow." A
similar-in-spirit observation is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putt%27s_Law_and_the_Successful_Technocrat">Putt's
Law</a> which says "<del>Technology</del>[Bureaucracy] is dominated by
two types of people, those who understand what they do not manage and
those who manage what they do not understand." Those two observation are
post-hoc rationalizations for managers with no apparent management
skills and a lack of technical skills.</p>
<p>For bureaucrats who don't seem effective in their role, try to
determine whether there is a lack of training, lack of awareness, or
lack of interest. Training can take the form of reading book or
attending a class. Lack of awareness can be addressed with measurements
of turn-overrate and surveying team members.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle">Peter
principle</a>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="1970_Peter">(Peter
1970)</span>: "People in a hierarchy tend to rise to 'a level of
respective incompetence': employees are promoted based on their success
in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer
competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to
another." This incompetence might manifest as recurring failure for a
person in a role they are inadequate for. More likely, your incompetence
will blind you to your failures.</p>
<p>To avoid falling victim to the Peter principal, do not seek promotion
until you have a track record of performing at the next level. The
downside is that you are working at a discounted rate since your are
providing value beyond what is expected of your grade. (That's
Dilemma&nbsp;<a href="#table:dilemma-personal-work-extra-or-work-as-expected"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-work-extra-or-work-as-expected">4.9</a>.)</p>
<p>The Peter principal has an element of truth, especially when a person
starts a new role. It takes time to find your footing in a new job.
However, you can learn their role and become competent.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="designing-incentives-determines-values">Designing Incentives
Determines Values</h3>
<p>Promotion is a critical when designing incentives for behavior.
Promotion is challenging to engineer because people a driven by various
motives like money, status, and authority.</p>
<p>Promotion typically focuses on the successes of a person. This
de-emphasizes teamwork and lessons learned from failures. Promotion of a
person (rather than the team) results in hero culture.</p>
<p>The risk tolerance of a bureaucratic organization is driven in part
by tensions in the promotion processes: an interest in success (more
success is better) and avoidance of failure (organizations don't promote
for failing). This imbalance can lead participants to seek ownership of
efforts that are likely to succeed, to seek easier successes, and to
stealing credit for outcomes created by other people.</p>
<p>The promotion process within an organization is coupled to the idea
of innovation, even if your promotion is at odds to taking risks.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.7"
id="ideas-for-innovation-within-a-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Ideas for Innovation within a
Bureaucracy<span id="sec:innovation" label="sec:innovation"></span></h2>
<p>As a bureaucrat in an organization, you will see deficiencies and
challenges. You could ignore the issues, complain but not take action,
work around (avoid) the issues, or try to improve your organization.
This section focuses on the last option.</p>
<p>Sometimes the issue and the apparent fix seem straightforward. If the
situation has persisted for a long time, consider why the conditions
have remained as is. Instead of framing your idea with, "Isn't it
obvious that things would be better if ...", learn why what seems
obvious doesn't happen. Learn the history. Talk to participants. If
there is agreement that the situation is harmful, why has no one else
tackled it? If previous attempts to innovate were tried and failed, why
did they fail? What is novel about your innovation compared to those?<a
href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>If you understand the conditions creating a challenge, and the
history of why other approaches failed, and you have an innovative
response, consider the stakeholders. Innovation is necessarily
disruptive to incumbent processes and teams and social power. Do the
incumbents benefit from the proposed innovation? Have they said they
will benefit, or are you projecting their response? Innovation that
benefits the organization but harms incumbents is less likely to
succeed.</p>
<p>In addition to the social hurdles, innovation requires taking risks
(otherwise the effort is merely incremental improvement). Risk in an
organization means the potential for losing time and resources (waste),
potential harm to reputation, or legal consequences.</p>
<p>Avoiding waste and harm are rational reactions when you are managing
shared resources on behalf of a community. The incentive against
innovation is the minimization of failure.</p>
<p>Anyone who fails can argue they were try to innovate. The distinction
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast#Business">fail
fast</a> is learning from failure and sharing that insight gained so
other people don't need to repeat your experience.</p>
<p>Once you decide to innovate, and after you've learned the history and
talked to participants, you have choices about how to innovate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Innovate while ignoring the bureaucracy. Your scope is limited to
what you can accomplish alone. Integration is tough and causes
frustration.</p></li>
<li><p>Fight to create a space free from bureaucracy to enable
innovation. You've intentionally isolated innovators from resources
present in the organization, and integration back into the org is now
more challenging.</p></li>
<li><p>Leverage existing hierarchy and processes. Can be frustrating to
work with bureaucrats who are not as focused as you are.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A recap of the innovation lifecycle in a bureaucracy:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You see problems and challenges in your environment. This
manifests as complaints from both the people directly harmed and
observers who see inefficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>You share ideas for innovation and gets feedback. Build a
coalition of people willing to fight for the idea on your behalf so that
when you're not present, the idea is still proceeding towards
implementation. That puts the threshold at "so important other people
are willing to pause whatever they were working on and take up your
cause."</p></li>
<li><p>Enacting these suggestions require either a change to existing
processes or new processes or an investment of work. These changes may
not succeed -- there's risk. Your idea could fail because it's not a good
idea. It could also fail because someone doesn't like you, or the idea
doesn't account for some dependency you weren't aware of, or it might
conflict with other changes in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do decide to invest effort, the activity takes you away
from your current work. Enacting the change might involve skills you
don't have; learning those skills takes time. Carrying out the activity
with new skills increases the likelihood of novice mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>If someone else enacts the idea they get the credit for having
done the work.</p></li>
<li><p>If the idea saves money or time, there's typically no monetary
reward. Recognition and benefit to your reputation isn't required as
part of the change process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are many barriers in that lifecycle. The problem has to be
observable to someone willing to invest effort in change. That person
has to build a coalition of stakeholders. If the person isn't negatively
harmed, that person may also lack clear benefit from resolving
inefficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In addition to the work of enacting the change, there is an
administrative overhead of documenting the reason for the change.
Subjective decisions mean choices have to be defensible. The need for
defensible justifications result in conservative decisions and risk
aversion and a decrease of motive for innovation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Don't bother buying new technology because there's a lot of risk and we
already know how to use the existing technology. (Same applies to
innovation with policies.)</p>
<p>The people in decision-making positions in the hierarchy have more
experience with existing technology and are therefore biased against
novel technology. Also, getting burned a few times on innovation makes
people more conservative.</p>
<p>With limited time and staff available within the organization,
experienced decision-makers are typically not on the bleeding edge of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">hype
cycle</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Bureaucrats, recognizing that bureaucracy stifles innovation, will
occasionally invest in internal innovation efforts. Because innovation
can come from unexpected sources, the process of innovation is opened to
everyone.</p>
<p>Incompetent people can innovate just as much as well-informed
experts, but the output of inexperienced people is more likely to be
disappointing, wasteful, or even harmful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p>These barriers lead to external observers to conclude something like
the following simplification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats
hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better
results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top
of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept?<a href="#fn48"

</div>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="changing-your-environment">Changing your
Environment</h3>
<p>Changing the bureaucratic organization you are a member of is
difficult. That applies regardless of your motive for change and the
thing to be changed. Regardless of motive, there are tactics applicable
to any change. The two major categories of change are <a
href="#sec:change-a-process">processes</a> (e.g., technical solutions,
changing policy) and changing the <span data-acronym-label="culture"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">culture</span> of the members of an
organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Culture is the set of norms that determine acceptable behavior for
members of the organization. Norms come from the expectations of your
fellow bureaucrats. Your coworkers can model desired behavior and
inflict punishments for deviations from norms. The culture of the
organization is practiced by members.</p>
<p>The expectations of culture should be stated explicitly. If the
explicitly stated norms are in conflict with what is experienced by the
organization's members the hypocrisy decimates trust.</p>
<p>Besides modeling desired norms in the organization, there are a few
more tactics you can take. Reinforce positive examples of desired
behavior with public praise and meaningful rewards. Punish examples of
undesirable norms.</p>
<p>Altering cultural norms of a bureaucratic organization means altering
member behavior, adjusting incentives to re-enforce the desired
behavior, punish undesirable behavior, and provide resources to make the
intended outcomes easier.</p>
<p>Although aspects of culture may be problematic, thinking of cultural
change as problem solving is not a useful framing. Bureaucrats don't
solve problems, they address challenges. The word "problem" implies
solution. The problem-solution framing is inaccurate in a bureaucracy
since altering the situation merely introduces novel challenges. Even
though you don't solve a challenge, you can still get a sense of
emotional reward from having improved the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Prior to investing effort in change, reflect on the emotional and career
impact of your effort. Will the work bring you joy, or is your emotional
reward tied to the outcome? If the outcome is the only source of reward,
you'll either be disappointed in failure or you will be more
conservative (intending to increase the likelihood of success). The work
of creating positive change can be joyful: you can form relationships
and focus on learning.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of change in a bureaucratic organization is
figuring out what is worth changing. There are many opportunities for
improvement. Talk to stakeholders and enumerate their challenges. From
the myriad stories, identify recurring themes and root causes. Typically
bureaucratic challenges intertwine technical, budget, staffing,
historical context, personalities of participants, and organizational
politics.</p>
<p>Select an aspect that you have some competence in and allows for
growth. If the challenge is big (many people involved, takes a long
time, cost a lot) can it be broken down into incremental challenges?
Distinguish wide-scale changes from local changes over which you have
more influence.</p>
<p>Having surveyed challenges worth addressing and picked an issue with
high return on investment, the guidance of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton%23Chesterton%27s_fence">Chesterton's
fence</a> says is that you shouldn't change something until you
understand why things are the way they are. Figuring out the history of
an issue can be work when there is a lack of historical records.</p>
<p>Talking to stakeholders in the survey phase may yield tidbits of
history. Why have previous efforts been rejected or not taken effect?
Written documentation of the history should be augmented by oral
folklore.</p>
<p>If your idea has a novel justification for success, identify all
possible methods of progress and then rank the tasks. If you can't do
all the work, who can you collaborate with? Can you delegate to people
with skills you lack, or will you have to gain new skills? If no one has
the relevant skills, becoming the widely-acknowledged expert gains
power.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="creating-change-in-the-organization">Creating
Change in the Organization<span id="sec:creating-change"
label="sec:creating-change"></span></h3>
<p>If the organization you are in has no problems or challenges, this
section can be skipped. For bureaucrats in organizations that do have
issues, this part of the book provides points to ponder independent of
the specific problem.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you have unique insight on the challenges the
organization faces, and you have unique leverage to alter the situation.
While you could proceed haphazardly, an effective bureaucrat has vision.
The vision is a story of what-could-be. This vision can be broken out as
goals: specific measurable outcomes. Each goal requires contingency
plans for achieving the goal. Plans are marked milestones which indicate
whether the plan is proceeding successfully.</p>
<p>Perspectives to consider when assessing change include what the
situation is, what the situation could be, and what the situation looks
like for different stakeholders. Each person has different information,
a different way of responding to issues, and shifting intents.</p>
<p>People who you depend on who have conflicting visions or no vision,
confounding your ability to improve the organization. There are
different views on whether something is actually a problem, distinct
characterizations of an issue, and competing priorities.</p>
<p>A trade-off to consider is that having niche impact is easier than
broad change (the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-scope-broad-vs-narrow">Dilemma of Scope of
Effect</a>). There's also a trade-off of the quick fix versus more
robust solutions (the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-quick-methodical">Dilemma of Speed and
Accuracy</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Understand and empathize with the fear of
change.<br />
When faced with a challenge, the options are to take action or to not
take action. If you take action, the options are failure, success, or
iteration. The choice of no action is attractive if you are not
suffering. Delay minimizes work, enables beneficial moves since the
player can wait out other players, and there are other things to focus
on.</p>
<p>Action incurs risk due to uncertainty and costs work to create
change.</p>
<p>Fear of failure is justified if and only if the cost of the failure
is greater than the value of lessons learned.</p>
<p>Fear of iteration is a fear that the process might be stopped
prematurely -- before perfection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Before starting a new effort, check to see whether
this has been tackled before. Learn the history of the problem. Why
hasn't this been solved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Query your first and second order social
network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Get feedback early before polishing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Advertise the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Hear criticism and respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Leverage both social networks and bureaucratic
processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Identify sources of power (hierarchical positions
and titles, social influence, reputation and credibility, buzzphrases or
popular paradigms) and leverage them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Professional respect (for what the other person
knows) and professional curiosity (for what you don't know)<br />
Example: Getting approval from multiple overseers in different
hierarchies is hard. Often different objectives and incentives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Use social recommendations to name relevant
individuals.<br />
Leverage the trust already in an existing social network by starting
with "Person A recommended I talk to you about X."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Sit in on meetings, listen to topics, see who is
talking, who is attending. After the meeting talk to individuals about
the meeting. Set up one-on-one informal discussions. Keep the first
conversation brief - 10 or 15 minutes. Your body language should
indicate engagement and interest. "Who else would you recommend talking
to?" is the last question in the first conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Consensus doesn't mean everyone agrees on the
problem, the remedy, or the approach, or who's taking the action.
Consensus in a bureaucracy means people aren't going to resist the
change.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="social-and-bureaucratic-interactions">Social
and Bureaucratic interactions<span id="sec:socializing"
label="sec:socializing"></span></h3>
<p>Change in a bureaucracy can apply to processes and people, but a more
amorphous concept is changing the culture of a team or organization.
What is meant by "culture" usually refers to norms -- the expectations of
behavior that individuals hold to. That definition of culture is
generic; what is meant within a bureaucratic context requires jargon for
the specific expectations.</p>
<p>To evaluate expectations we start by introducing categories of
interactions. Interactions among members of an organization are either a
social interaction or a bureaucratic interaction.</p>
<p>As examples of each of these,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Social interaction example</em>: "Did you see the game on TV
last night? Our team really did well, right? I wanted to get tickets for
the game but they were sold out."</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bureaucratic interaction example</em>: "You'll need to get
approval from Sue before presenting your idea to the board for their
review. Then talk with Russ and get his thoughts about how to
proceed."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both social and bureaucratic interactions are vital to cohesion in an
organization.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic interaction can be broken into two subcategories: <span
data-acronym-label="visible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">visible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are written down and can be discovered by
stakeholders) and <span data-acronym-label="invisible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">invisible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are known to some stakeholders and are
conveyed verbally to some of the other stakeholders).</p>
<p>Invisible bureaucracy is akin to related topics outside the
professional environment: invisible domestic work<a href="#fn49"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
and invisible relationship work.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> The work associated
with emotional cohesion, logistics, planning, scheduling, and
communicating is hard to quantify so it does not get counted.</p>
<p>The relevance of this jargon is to break down the components of an
organization's "culture" experienced by participants. When someone in
the organization advocates for changing the culture, which expectations
are they specifically referring to? Invisible bureaucracy is the hardest
to alter because it is undocumented and not counted.</p>
<p>Processes default to invisible bureaucracy because creating and
maintaining documentation requires work. Making the documentation
discoverable requires work. To make invisible bureaucracy visible,
document the work and enable other people to find the documentation.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.8" id="measuring-bureaucratic-maturity"><span
class="header-section-number">5.8</span> Measuring Bureaucratic
Maturity</h2>
<p>Bureaucratic maturity of bureaucrats in an organization can be broken
into three behaviors: complaining, seeing opportunity, and finding <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudges</a>.</p>
<p>The first and most wide spread behavior is to see a problem and then
complain about the situation. This indicates awareness of the
environment but no creativity regarding what to do about the
problems.</p>
<p>The second, less common behavior, is to see a problem and recognize
the situation as an opportunity. This requires creativity and
reframing.</p>
<p>The third behavior is to see a problem and then <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudge</a> the
situation towards a vision. The nudges could be through either direct
action or by influencing others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
An individual bureaucrat can show one or more of these behaviors. That
is, being capable of the third behavior does not mean the person lacks
the ability to complain on other topics.</p>
<p>There is not a specific amount of experience within the organization
needed to arrive at any of these three paradigms. A holistic
understanding of the system helps.</p>
<p>The "vision" of the third behavior could be in the form of a
long-term (temporally distant) outcome, or the vision could be of
immediate multi-party cooperation.</p>

<p>You were hired to do a job. That job relies on technical skills
you've accumulated through education and experience. Now you're a member
of the team. You'll need to interact with other bureaucrats for various
reasons: delegating tasks, asking for help, offering help, seeking
input, and offering input. While that generic observation sounds
reasonable, in practice you encounter significant friction in getting
things done. If everyone participating in a process thinks they are
doing the right thing, then why are there suboptimal outcomes? Potential
reasons include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each participant in the process may have a limited view of other
parts of the process. Each person talks only to adjacent
participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Each participant typically has a limited scope of responsibility.
They don't need to know everything. Specialization can improve
efficiency and cause harm.</p></li>
<li><p>Each participant typically has a limited scope of authority. Even
if the person knows more than their role, they lack control over other
aspects of the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants typically have insufficient time, resources, and
expertise to enact improvements.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants in the process may have a common goal but use
different methods for addressing the challenges.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all potential constraints; they don't exclude being
effective or improving the process. You can learn what someone else's
priorities are and why those are priorities.</p>
<p>Solo work may be more emotionally rewarding due to fewer external
constraints, but the cost is that task complexity and scope are limited
to the skills of the individual.</p>
<p>When you can't do everything yourself, you rely on your team and
members of the broader organization. You can treat this loss of
independence within the organization (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation">deindividuation</a>)
as either sublimation (and feel suffocated) or an extension of your
capacity and abilities (and feel empowered).</p>
<p>Working with others allows you to occasionally accomplish complex
results beyond your skills or your bandwidth despite collaborators not
being under your control. How? Through persuasion. The challenge of
collaboration is to multiply productivity rather than merely sum the
output of a set of individuals.</p>
<p>Inside an organization, cooperation/coordination is not held together
by internal contracts or even <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">service-level
agreements</a>. What keeps the organization together is the force of
will of participants.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="your-value-to-fellow-bureaucrats">Your Value
to Fellow Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>When you engage fellow bureaucrats as part of a process, you are
investing your attention in the relationship. Relationships take time,
which is time not spent on other opportunities. In addition to your time
(and theirs), the other two factors are your attention and alertness. To
illustrate the relevance of those aspects, consider the following. I can
talk to you for 15 minutes, but if your attention is directed toward
your phone, then you're not fully engaged with me. If you are paying
attention during the time we have together but haven't slept for 36
hours, your alertness may not be 100%.</p>
<p>When interacting with fellow bureaucrats, are you giving them your
attention? Are you alert to their input? While engaging, determine if
they are not attentive or alert. You can be curious and ask if deferring
the interaction would allow them to give more of their attention. If
you're not feeling alert, let the people you're interacting with
know.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.1" id="motives-of-bureaucrats"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Motives of Bureaucrats<span
id="sec:motivations" label="sec:motivations"></span></h2>
<p>Learning the diverse motives of bureaucrats you depend upon is
instructive for finding causes of delay or opposition. If you expect
everyone to have the same motives as you, then you will be surprised by
the friction created by diverse motives.</p>
<p>Motivations of participants are rarely, "How can I make the
organization more successful?" or even, "How can I sell or produce more
product?" Usually motivation is based on personal fulfillment in various
manifestations. By learning the motives of each bureaucrat - what they
value in terms of a utility function, and how they perceive risk - then
you can gather data relevant to the argument and frame the narrative
more effectively.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats on the same team with similar skill sets have similar
external incentives. However, their intrinsic motives may be different
and result in distinct behaviors. Within an organization, bureaucrats
differ due to their intrinsic motivations, extrinsic incentives, and the
person's risk tolerance. These three factors combine into emergent
phenomena, leading teams and organizations to act in ways no individual
member would. The dissonance of how (personified) organizations behave
confounds observers outside the bureaucracy. If you were to talk to each
member you could find a reason for that person's behavior.</p>
<p>Each bureaucrat has a motive, even the bureaucrats who do nothing.
Bureaucratic nihilism (showing up for your job but choosing to not
provide value) is an option but it is not without cost. In an
organization where you are a paid bureaucrat, you are either actively
working to improve the organization or your existence is parasitic to
the organization. There is no "idle" status for paid employees in an
organization with limited resources.</p>
<p>Employees may choose to stop contributing value if they perceive that
a lack of action will not harm their options. There is a perceived
disconnect between their actions and the consequences for the
organization. This is not pure nihilism, as the person still benefits
from showing up (usually a paycheck).</p>
<p>Rationalizing money as the cause for action is just one of many
potential sources. There are a variety of motivations and incentives for
bureaucrats: stability (aka job security, the comfort of a routine),
money (current pay or future earnings), travel, problem-solving, status,
exerting power or control, the credibility of being associated with the
organization (if the organization has a positive reputation), logistical
convenience ("the office is near where I live"), service to people the
organization serves.</p>
<p>As an example incentive for a bureaucrat, I want to avoid being too
efficient such that I eliminate the need for my job, while not so
inefficient that the organization fails and I lose my job. Increasing
the efficiency of bureaucracy is desirable for the organization and the
outcomes, but can be harmful to the bureaucrat's career.</p>
<p>The consequence of diverse motives is that expecting bureaucratic
organizations to be logical, fair, consistent, and efficient is
unreasonable even when every participant wants those features. Each
bureaucrat thinks, "I am logical, fair, consistent, and efficient."
Therefore each bureaucrat expects other bureaucrats to meet those same
(unrealistic) standards. Next, anthropomorphize the team or organization
and expect the group to meet those standards.</p>
<p>Even if each bureaucrat were logical, fair, consistent, and efficient
(they are not, and neither are you), each person has a different
motivation. Internal motivation depends on what you value in the sense
of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">utility</a>
function. Each person wants to accomplish something different using
their unique skills and reference their own experiences. Compounding the
confusion, each bureaucrat has to coordinate using communication that
has latency and limited bandwidth and isn't precise.</p>
<p>When viewed from the outside, an expectation that bureaucracy feels
illogical, unfair, inconsistent, and inefficient is a useful baseline.
From inside the bureaucracy, a baseline expectation is that every
bureaucrat is driven by different motives and uses distinct ways to
tackle challenges. Working against bureaucratic entropy (an ongoing
investment) yields improvements even though perfection is
inaccessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The above discussion might leave you with the impression that individual
bureaucrats are distinct. While that's true, with a sufficient number of
different people there are recurring themes that are detectable. The
next section identifies common tropes you might encounter.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2" id="bureaucratic-tropes"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Bureaucratic Tropes<span
id="sec:tropes" label="sec:tropes"></span></h2>
<p>Any sufficiently large organization will have a diverse group of
bureaucrats. From that diversity certain tropes emerge.<a href="#fn51"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
The value of recognizing these recurring patterns is to leverage their
strengths so that you and that person can be more effective.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Excited intern or new
employee</strong>.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Their enthusiasm can be channeled to take on
challenges other bureaucrats are scared of taking on for political
reasons. Their na&#xEF;vet&#xE9; should be remedied by pairing them with a mentor
who can explain the organization's history and specific
challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Retired in place</strong>.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Recognizing this attitude allows you to temper
your expectations about their productivity.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Font of institutional memory</strong>.
Likes to explain how the current situation relates to his experience ten
years ago.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can benefit from talking to this person
about historical processes and what has been tried before.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>"Let them eat cake" managers</strong> who
are removed from challenges and deny the problem is a problem.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: It is worth figuring out whether these
managers actually don't care, or if they are busy fighting battles you
are not exposed to.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>"Don't rock the boat"</strong> people who
tried changing the system, didn't succeed, and are emotionally beaten
down such that they no longer try.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: These people are often creative and can be
consulted before you tackle a challenge they have experience
with.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>The Patriot</strong> is willing to
sacrifice for the organization.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Educate them that there are alternative ways
to be effective in a bureaucracy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Mismatched</strong> -- this person's
skills and interests don't match their role, so they are despondent and
frustrated.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can provide value to this person by
networking with them and finding better opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Friendly grouch</strong> is friendly and
helpful but unhappy in their job due to bureaucracy and other
hurdles.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Provide a copy of this book to increase their
effectiveness and improve their spirits. They will be grateful to you
and the organization will benefit.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Detail-oriented</strong> -- you ask them
what time it is and they'll tell you how to build a clock.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can serve as their ambassador to other
members of the team or organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above personality tropes apply to individuals. If your team works
on multiple projects, you may identify project tropes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>We've always done it this
way</strong>.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: The team is scared of change. The change may be
known (and undesirable) or unknown. Change disrupts power.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can brainstorm with the team ways to
improve incrementally.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Individual solutions to systemic
challenges</strong>.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Demonstrating small wins helps build
credibility.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Plan to ramp up complexity (towards the
systemic challenges) and <a href="#sec:reputation">spend the earned
reputation</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Team tropes can emerge from either the top-down directives made by
supervisors or by the collective (in)actions of team members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Tropes as labeled patterns of behavior can decrease surprise when you
first encounter them and can help you develop constructive
responses.</p>
<p>The last set of tropes is on the topic of bureaucratic problems.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-solve-problems">How to Solve
Problems</h3>
<p>Not every bureaucrat responds to challenges the same way.
Understanding the diversity of potential reactions (or inaction) before
you encounter them decreases the surprise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Solve the problem. This is the engineering approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a simpler problem. This is the Physics approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a more abstract problem. This is the Mathematical
approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a different problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize and ignore the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>What problem?</p></li>
<li><p>Assign someone else the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Redefine the problem so that it is already solved. "That's not a
problem; that's how it's supposed to work."</p></li>
<li><p>Apply for resources (staff, training, money) to solve the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Point to the problem as a justification for more
resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Give a talk about the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a paper about the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach a course on the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk to your therapist about the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Your manager declares the problem solved and gets a
bonus.</p></li>
<li><p>Reframe the problem as an opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>Study the problem in the context of the broader system.</p></li>
<li><p>Study the problem from other people's perspectives.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the impact of the problem on the broader system.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a set of activities for role-playing parts of the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve part of the problem. Then another part.</p></li>
<li><p>Research whether anyone else worked on the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Find other instances of the problem that were already
solved.</p></li>
<li><p>Find similar problems and identify the differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Contract out the solution and select a bid.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why the problem does not need to be solved.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why the problem is beneficial.</p></li>
<li><p>Form a team and set a mission statement addressing the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Slow-roll the problem until you don't need to worry about the
problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Did you recognize any of those responses from your past experiences?
Were any unexpected?</p>
<h2 data-number="6.3" id="not-my-job-task-scope"><span
class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Not My Job: Task Scope</h2>
<p>If you ask someone for help on a task that benefits your team, that
person might respond that the task is "not my job" and explain that time
spent on tasks like what you're asking for gets in the way of their
progress. The emotionally engaging work is not that task.</p>
<p>This recurring pattern is sufficiently common that at least one
domain has jargon for the concept. '<a
href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scut">Scut</a>' is
medical slang for the non-clinical yet essential tasks that do not
require a doctor's degree or expertise. Another label used for
non-central tasks is administrivia (short for administrative tasks).</p>
<p>A mindset related to the "not my job" view is the following. "Once I
realized someone else has the same problem, I stopped worrying about
it." The separation of scope can be reasonable (no point in duplicating
effort) but may cause harm (when there's no coordination). The "not my
job" refusal is merely about scope.</p>
<p>The potential reasons for this reluctance to help include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Working on the task will not get them promoted.</p></li>
<li><p>Their understanding of the scope of their job and their expertise
does not include the task.</p></li>
<li><p>The person doesn't know how to do the task and they don't want to
learn.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, progress as measured by the individual refusing to help
is not aligned with the success of the organization. You can escalate
the request up the chain of command to get a determination about whether
the collaboration should happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Asking for help and giving (or refusing to give) help is dependent on
your reputation. The next section addresses how you can manage your
reputation in a bureaucratic context.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.4"
id="building-managing-and-spending-reputation"><span
class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Building, Managing, and
Spending Reputation<span id="sec:reputation"
label="sec:reputation"></span></h2>
<p>This section is about actions you can take to create a reputation.
Even if you don't intentionally build a reputation, you still get one
because you interact with other people. Also in this section: how to
spend political capital -- both yours and that of your team.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="relevance-of-reputation-in-a-bureaucracy">Relevance of Reputation in
a Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>As a bureaucrat you may want to be all things to all people. Since
that is not feasible, you have to limit your scope and therefore
disappoint some people. This same dynamic of a limited scope applies to
the team you are on, and again to the organization the team is part of.
The purpose of a bureaucratic team or bureaucratic organization is to
manage a <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span> for a
constituency. The constituency will invariably be disappointed because
access to the shared resource is limited.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can influence how others perceive your
limitations. their perception of your value is shaped by your investment
in relationships and by your creative negotiations with other
bureaucrats.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="definition-of-reputation">Definition of
Reputation</h3>
<p>Your <span data-acronym-label="reputation"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">reputation</span> as a bureaucrat is
what other people expect from you. Reputation is perception. What does
that person think of you? Your team? Your organization? Reputation is
set whenever and where ever you are observed, or artifacts are
associated with you. What you wear matters to how you are perceived.
When you show up impacts your reputation. How your written communication
is read alters perceptions. People are informed by your body posture in
meetings.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="reputation-brand-image">Reputation, Brand,
Image</h3>
<p>There are multiple phrases that all refer to the same concept of
being perceived and generating associated expectations. Individuals
create (or get) a reputation; organizations have brands. A team of
bureaucrats can have a reputation.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="your-reputation-matters">Your Reputation
matters</h3>
<p>Your reputation within the organization dramatically impacts your
effectiveness. People will let you do things (or prevent you from doing
things) based on their expectations of you.</p>
<p>Your reputation alters your influence. Whether other people turn to
you for input depends on what they expect from you. How others perceive
you impacts what you can accomplish and when people seek your help or
input.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="you-can-manage-your-reputation">You can
Manage your Reputation</h3>
<p>Managing reputation means acknowledging that your interaction with
others is partially performative. This may feel disappointing if you
want to be judged solely on your productivity or knowledge.</p>
<p>Your success is limited if you focus exclusively on doing the work,
and your success is limited if you focus exclusively on performative
aspects. Neglecting to manage your reputation means you lose input to
the stories others tell about you. Active management of your reputation
requires engaging with people and generating evidence.</p>
<p>Your reputation is dynamically changing based on your activities and
communication. Your communication matters, and the stories other people
tell about you matter.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="techniques-for-building-reputational-capital">Techniques for
Building Reputational Capital</h3>
<p>Ideally your reputation would be based on your technical skills, your
ability to collaborate with other people, the strength of your network,
and your creativity. None of those matters if the person you're engaging
with doesn't know those things. You build your reputation by doing
things that are useful contributions, are visible to other people, and
are associated with you (or your team or organization). This positive
association is what you are creating.</p>
<p>Because the definition of reputation is about expectations other
people have about you, what you choose to work on matters. How you work
on your tasks (creativity, enthusiasm, dedication), the artifacts
produced, and your ability to communicate all shape your reputation.</p>
<p>When building your reputation, you can work on multiple small wins or
take larger risks on bigger bets. The bigger bets provide faster
leverage of reputational capital as you have demonstrated your
worthiness and skill.</p>
<p>The same concepts apply to teams of bureaucrats and bureaucratic
organizations. Just as individuals compete for resources, teams compete
for budget, staffing, and glory. How the team's budget and staffing are
spent impact reputation.</p>
<p>A specific technique for building a good reputation is <a
href="#sec:credit-others">giving others credit</a>. This may seem
counter-intuitive if you are focused on the apparent assignment of
credit. What matters is that other people observe you (whether directly
or indirectly) giving credit.</p>
<p>Similarly, another technique for building good reputation is offering
to <a href="#sec:take-blame">take blame</a>. Again, this can seem
counter-intuitive since being blamed doesn't sound good. The value is in
proclaiming your willingness to be blamed such that other people observe
your offer.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="using-good-news-or-early-news-to-build-influence">Using Good News
(or Early News) to build Influence</h3>
<p>Rather than tell good news directly to a top-level decision-maker,
first inform the person who influences the decision-maker. You can tell
the influencer the information does not need to be credited to
yourself.</p>
<p>The benefits of this approach include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improves the influencer's reputation with the
decision-maker.</p></li>
<li><p>The influencer can contextualize the information for the
decision-maker.</p></li>
<li><p>The influencer can leverage the information in ways you would not
have.</p></li>
<li><p>My reputation with the influencer is enhanced.</p></li>
<li><p>You reaffirm the influencer's role and status.</p></li>
<li><p>Influencers can be easier to access.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-spend-reputation">How to Spend
Reputation</h3>
<p>Based on your reputation (what the other person expects), what trust
does that person have? You can then use that trust to do things that
might not otherwise be feasible. You can spend your reputation to bend
rules.</p>
<p>Reputation is not the only thing you as a bureaucrat can spend. Other
examples include your time (up to your entire career), your ability to
be a member of the team or organization, your self-respect, and your
ability to be promoted or receive bonuses. At the level of the team and
the organization, additional aspects to spend are budget and staff. Each
of these (reputation, time, membership, budget, staffing) are potential
investments.</p>
<p>When considering what to spend to build reputation, consider what
boundaries you have. Things you might not want to spend include your
integrity and your health (physical, mental, emotional). Similar
boundaries apply at the team an organization level -- trust in the team,
the well-being of team members.</p>
<p>Whenever you engage within your team, you are either actively
spending or building your reputation within the team. Whenever you are
engaging with people from outside your team, you are either actively
spending or building your team's reputation. Because of that, spending
reputation means taking risks that involve other people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Examples of spending reputation and not getting a return on the
investment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ask for a favors and provide no value.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore options that other people don't see as worthwhile and
then there's no payoff.</p></li>
<li><p>Produce nothing of value to the organization or other
people.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk with people outside your team and misrepresent the efforts
of your team.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak honestly about the faults of your team to people outside
your team.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="6.5" id="intellectual-empathy"><span
class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Intellectual Empathy<span
id="sec:intellectual-empathy"
label="sec:intellectual-empathy"></span></h2>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you will work with people who are smarter on a
specific topic than you are. That superior knowledge might come from
experience or from formal education.</p>
<p>The person with superior knowledge may be able to convey their
knowledge to you, or they may struggle to. That struggle could be due to
an inability to break down complex insights, or they don't recognize the
mismatch between what they know and what you understand. This same
scenario can be reversed -- you might be more knowledgeable on a given
topic than some other bureaucrat you work with. In either situation,
both parties have responsibilities for <span
data-acronym-label="intellectual empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">intellectual empathy</span>. The more
knowledgeable person needs to understand what they can build on when
talking with the less knowledgeable person, and the less knowledgeable
person has to be clear about what is making sense and what does not.</p>
<p>I often start conversations with people who are new to me by asking
about their professional background -- their education, past work
experience, and other aspects that would allow me to build on their
existing knowledge. This allows me to tailor the conversation to the gap
of knowledge that exists when we are discussing a challenge.</p>
<p>During a conversation you can monitor body language for reactions
like a squint, a head tilt, an eyebrow raise or an eyebrow furrowed.
Those are common reactions when information doesn't conform to what the
listener expected.</p>
<p>A more direct method is to ask about the other person's knowledge of
the topic. The phrasing "Do you know about (name of topic)?" is less
effective than "What do you know about (name of topic)?" Respondents
might claim experience or knowledge of a topic, but probing for the
difference between "I've heard those words before" versus "I was part of
a team that implemented (topic)" versus "I came up with the original
idea for (topic)" is helpful.</p>
<p>Sometimes the person with less knowledge on a topic feels
uncomfortable with indicating their confusion, or sometimes the person
doesn't realize they are missing the main point. The more knowledgeable
person can check in with the listener to confirm. "What did you get from
what I just talked about?" is a better confirmation than "You understood
what I meant, right?" The person with less knowledge can proactively
check their knowledge by providing a read-back: "Here's what I
understood you to mean: ..." These check-ins, regardless of who
initiates, should be relatively frequent when exploring complex
topics.</p>
<p>Admitting ignorance can be intimidating and may feel like you risk
losing the other person's respect. A gentler way of saying "I'm lost" is
"I was following up until the point where you described ..."
Intellectual empathy is the responsibility of both parties in a
conversation.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.6" id="leveraging-expertise"><span
class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Leveraging Expertise<span
id="sec:expertise" label="sec:expertise"></span></h2>
<p>The definition of <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is the management
of shared resources on behalf of a community. In addition to tangible
shared resources like land, water, and air, an intangible resource
accessed by a community is expertise. Bureaucrats are responsible for
finding people with expertise, vetting claims of expertise, and
deploying expertise for the benefit of a community.</p>
<p>Experts who accumulate knowledge and experience look for ways to
apply their expertise. Finding the relevant decision-makers and
providing context for decisions can feel satisfying when positive
outcomes benefit a community.</p>
<p>The following two sections address both viewpoints: that of a
bureaucrat seeking expert help, and that of an expert providing help.
Bridging the cultural divide and knowledge gap in both directions is
necessary for the success of an organization.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="non-experts-seeking-experts">Non-experts
seeking Experts</h3>
<p>Before you seek the help of an expert, your first instinct may be to
try and proceed on your own. <em>How hard could this be? Looks
straightforward enough...</em> That do-it-myself approach is a plateau
you can remain on for an entire career. Or perhaps you encounter
difficulties and realize your limitations. You may seek help from a peer
or a trusted consultant. Seeking help from those around you is a second
plateau that may suffice for the issue you're responding to.</p>
<p>Finding an expert can be difficult to distinguish from talking with
non-experts who know something you don't. If you decide a challenge
requires skills you don't have, anyone with those skills has more
expertise than you. Expertise is relative.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="finding-experts">Finding Experts</h4>
<p>One reason you as a bureaucrat seek an expert is you don't have
expertise yourself. (If your motivation is merely to seek an external
scapegoat that can be blamed, then getting any expert that appears
convincing will suffice.)</p>
<p>One technique for finding a relevantly qualified expert is to
triangulate. Seek guidance from your existing social network. Multiple
referrals from independent parties are a positive indicator. That is not
the same as vetting the person's claimed expertise.</p>
<p>Once you've identified a potential expert, you'll need to evaluate
their expertise and the ability to collaborate. This is inherently
difficult since you lack the expertise you are seeking.</p>
<p>Do people defer to the candidate because of the candidate's title,
the candidate's position in the hierarchy, the candidate's experience,
or the candidate's knowledge of technical details? Those can each
qualify someone as an expert, but the title and position are least-well
coordinated with expertise. Even experience can be misleading: ten years
of doing a job can sometimes mean just doing the same first-year
activities for ten years. Evaluating an expert's depth of insight is
often relegated to peers in the same field.</p>
<p>When signaled solely by credentials, expertise is independent of
experience. The expert may lack ability to communicate their knowledge
with people outside their domain</p>
<p>Within an area of expertise there may be sub-disciplines that you are
not familiar with. Don't be embarrassed to ask the expert you find what
subfield they have experience in, and their evaluation of how well that
aligns with the effort you're recruiting them for.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="communicating-with-experts">Communicating
with Experts</h4>
<p>A common barrier to successful collaboration is use of jargon by
experts. Jargon can serve two purposes: to signal group membership
(which is harmful to people outside the group); and to be more precise
about a concept (desirable). An pseudo-expert may use jargon relevant to
a topic but not be able to explain the concept to you.</p>
<p>If you're tackling a complex challenge, you may need experts from
different disciplines. This introduces added challenges of
cross-discipline communication.</p>
<p>As a way of distinguising people who know more than you do, consider
the following levels of expertise.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Self-designated expert is unfamiliar with domain-specific
jargon.</p></li>
<li><p>Pseudo-expert can use jargon in discussion but cannot expand the
definition or provide analogs.</p></li>
<li><p>Pseudo-expert has memorized definitions and has analogies but
doesn't grasp underlying relations and principles. Boundaries of what to
apply where are uncertain.</p></li>
<li><p>Expert can map situation-of-interest to underlying relations and
principles, then use that mapping to remedy the issue (or explain why a
fix is infeasible). The result works and the solution wasn't obvious to
non-experts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For bureaucrats seeking to leverage experts there is the confusing
use of caveats. People who don't have a depth of knowledge are more
likely to be overconfident, while people who do have expertise are
cautious to include caveats and limitations.<a href="#fn52"

id="for-experts-looking-to-help-non-expert-decision-makers">For Experts
looking to help non-expert decision-makers</h3>
<p>Providing help to decision-makers can be an emotionally rewarding
application of your skills. The interaction with bureaucrats can also
feel devastating when you aren't listened to, you aren't understood, or
your input is perverted in ways you didn't want. Identify strengths your
audience has and build on those.</p>
<p>You, the expert, may not win any debates based on number of years of
experience. Some audiences may have many years in the field. However,
expertise (rather than experience) is what they can benefit from.</p>
<p>To establish boundaries on advice-giving, identify areas in which you
have specialized knowledge and which areas the non-expert audience has
insights that you do not. Respect and account for the expertise of the
audience (especially when they work in a different field). Acknowledge
your limits and account for their limits.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on providing expertise as a single-dimensional
relation, find ways to relate personally to audience members. The
purpose of creating and maintaining a personal relationship is necessary
because they will need to trust in you.</p>
<p>You don't have to teach a group all-at-once. You can tailor
one-on-one teaching, and the audience may feel less worried about asking
dumb questions. Once you've taught more than one person, they can help
each other translate the skill.</p>
<p>Being the sole subject matter expert in an organization can feel
isolating. You are constantly educating others but the stakeholders are
not expected to become your peers. Typically stakeholders want to know
just enough to make a decision.</p>
<p>You should explicitly acknowledge to your audience that expertise is
relative. When there are no other experts locally available who you can
ask questions of, turning to membership in professional organizations is
an option.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a risk that your expertise is crucial to the
decision-maker. That dependence can result in you thinking that you are
important, but it also means the decision-maker will be less successful
if you are unavailable. You should invest in cultivating your
replacement.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.7" id="does-anyone-want-to-volunteer"><span
class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Does Anyone Want to
Volunteer?</h2>
<p>Bureaucracy relies on coordination to facilitate the management of
shared resources. In the course of coordination, new tasks arise that
have no one clear person responsible. The word volunteer has two
meanings in this setting: contributing without seeking financial gain,
and choosing to contribute of your own free will.</p>
<p>When the facilitator of a meeting asks the group, "Does anyone want
to volunteer for this task?" the question is often met with silence. No
one wants extra work that does not benefit them, even if there is
benefit to the team or organization. The lack of response is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy of
the commons</a>, but in an anticipatory sense. Instead of asking this
poorly-framed question, the facilitator can get higher engagement with
the following tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ask each person in the meeting whether they are attending to
passively observe or to participate.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person willing to participate how much time they able to
invest. Responses could be zero hours, one hour (non-recurring), one
hour per month, or something else.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what their goals in the interaction are. It is
usually generic ("I want the group to succeed.") but it can be narrow,
in which case that gives you something to focus on.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what they are good at and what skills they have.
Are they good with personal interaction? Writing? Computers?
Coordinating? Logistics? Fundraising? Making phone calls?</p></li>
<li><p>From the inventory of tasks, are there any that fit both the
skills and time? Can the task be scoped to fit the time? If there are
multiple candidate tasks for a volunteer, let them pick the task. (If no
existing task aligns with their skills, do not create work to be
assigned.)</p></li>
<li><p>If there are other people working on the same task, put the
volunteer in contact with the other people.</p></li>
<li><p>Give the volunteer a deadline for the task. Your deadline should
not be arbitrary -- it should be based on the task dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that the volunteer is willing to commit the time to
complete the tasks by the deadline.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule a check-in with the volunteer before the task deadline
to review progress.</p></li>
<li><p>To create accountability among multiple volunteers, hold a group
review to explain how each participant's work contributes to the goals
and how work done by one person enables the next task done by someone
else. (Enumerate the dependency graph; include deadlines.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As the facilitator looking to designate tasks to participants, the
above tactics align the work with the skills of contributors.</p>
<p>As a contributor, your obligations to the team are knowing how much
time you have to contribute and being clear about the relative
priorities of tasks. Explaining that the new task is lower priority than
all your other obligations is a valid response. Your responsibility is
to negotiate with the person looking to assign new work and the people
who depend on results of your current tasks.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.1"
id="communication-is-critical-for-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Communication is Critical for
Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is a system of distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making. Distributed decision-making relies on effective
communication. Bureaucrats communicate by writing and speaking; both
methods convey incomplete information and are imprecise. The inability
to communicate comprehensively and precisely means iteration is helpful
when establishing a shared mental model of the situation and plan.</p>
<p>The dependence on iterative interactions means relationships matter
for communication. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metcalfe's law</a>
says the value of an organization is proportional to the square of the
number of people interacting in the organization. A team of 5 people is
not just the aggregated skills of five individuals -- there's the synergy
arising from ten bilateral relationships. Broadening your network of
collaborators increases your potential effectiveness and, symmetrically,
the reach of your fellow bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Suppose that you don't invest in relationships with your fellow
bureaucrats. Then you'll be less likely to know what is happening in
your organization, and you won't understand why certain decisions were
made. Your confusion might lead you to focus on your interests since
that is what you have some control over and insight on. Being selfish
doesn't leverage the potential synergy of collaboration, but at least
you look busy.</p>
<p>The analysis above applies to each person in the bureaucratic
organization. The consequence is that the organization's goals are not
achieved when bureaucrats act independently. There is a way out of this:
broadcast your intent to other people, be transparent with decisions,
and share the results of your activities. That decreases the confusion
other people may have about your actions and can improve everyone's
effectiveness. You can make yourself and the organization more effective
even when your investment in communication is not reciprocated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Information within a bureaucracy shapes the relationships among
bureaucrats. You have a choice: you can decide to not share information,
you can be transparent, or you can be vulnerable. Not sharing
information can harm or protect relationships. Being transparent conveys
"here's what is happening." Being vulnerable expands transparency to
explain "here's why that's happening or what might happen." Each of
those options informs how your coworkers, peers, management, and team
members interpret their perception of your intent. Your communication
shapes your <a href="#sec:reputation">reputation</a>.</p>
<p>Another way communication alters bureaucratic organizations is when
actions informed by locally-available information produce <a
href="#sec:failure-to-comm">suboptimal results for participants</a>, as
illustrated by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner's
dilemma</a>. Bureaucrats rarely have access to the holistic view of
their organization. Bureaucrats have a narrow view of their team and
interfaces to adjacent teams. The concept of "locally-available
information" applies to communication among bureaucrats that facilitates
delegation of work, allocation of resources, relationship
creation/maintenance, and carrying out processes.</p>
<p>If having a holistic view yields better results, why not just do that
instead of relying on local information? Each bureaucrat benefits from
gathering information that shapes their actions, but communication has a
cost: time spent building and verifying consensus delays action. There
is an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity
cost</a> when you spend time talking with people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The explanations above should convince you that communication is
critical for bureaucracy, and essential for being an effective
bureaucrat. Communication is typically thought of as occurring between
two or more people, but before we get there we'll focus on our <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapersonal_communication">inner
monologue</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.2"
id="communication-reflects-and-shapes-your-thinking"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Communication Reflects and
Shapes Your Thinking</h2>
<p>Before you talk to another person, you have an internal dialog about
how to interpret events and what you think will happen in the future.
Your inner monologue shapes your expectations and your actions. When you
talk with fellow bureaucrats you're sharing some of your thoughts and
allowing their thoughts to shape your contemplations.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you might have a few complaints you've thought about
regarding your team or organization. Complaining about bureaucracy is a
common way for bureaucrats to bond. Complaints occasionally lead to
insights, but that's typically not the goal.</p>
<p>By changing how you think about challenges you face, you can alter
your perception and your reputation. As an example of this change, can
you turn complaints into impact statements? The following examples show
how to spin a negative experience. You don't need to provide a
solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Negative observation</em>: "Logging into my computer takes a long
time."<br />
<em>Positive statement with explanation of impact</em>: "If I were able
to log into my computer more quickly, then I could accomplish more
tasks."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Negative observation</em>: "I need support from a team that doesn't
offer a ticket tracking system."<br />
<em>Positive statement with explanation of impact</em>: "If the service
team I need support from offered a ticket tracking system, then I would
be able to know the status of my request."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Negative observation</em>: "When I submit a ticket for a support
request to the team, I don't have visibility on the status of the
request."<br />
<em>Positive statement with explanation of impact</em>: "If the service
team I need support from offered visibility into their ticket tracking
status, then I could proceed with other tasks knowing my request wasn't
lost."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Sharing negativity is a way of commiserating, but it doesn't indicate to
other people that you're adding value. When you notice a complaint, can
you frame it as describing why the issue matters?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Another framing that is harmful to your thinking and how you communicate
is the use of generalizations. Personifying other teams and
organizations is a simpler-to-understand and simpler-to-describe model,
though the simplification is often incorrect.</p>
<p>Here's a progression that shows how to transform generalizations into
action:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This organization does not like blueberry pie.</p></li>
<li><p>No one in this organization likes blueberry pie.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know of anyone in the organization who likes blueberry
pie.</p></li>
<li><p>I like blueberry pie. How would I find someone else in the
organization who wants blueberry pie?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the first statement we personify an organization. Organizations
cannot like or dislike tangible items, so that statement is meaningless.
The second statement is slightly more precise (individual people can
have likes and dislikes) though still a generalization and therefore
likely inaccurate. Did you really confirm with every member of the
organization that they do not like blueberry pie? The source of the
generalization might be your lack of relationships with every member of
the organization. That leads to the fourth statement which is correct,
precise, and curious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Now that you've reflected on how your internal dialog alters your
perceptions and actions, the next section describes how communication
goes wrong.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.3" id="failure-to-communicate"><span
class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Failure to Communicate<span
id="sec:failure-to-comm" label="sec:failure-to-comm"></span></h2>
<p>Communication is critical in bureaucracy because bureaucracy is a
system of distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making. When
less effective communication occurs, individual bureaucrats are less
able to rely on the knowledge of other experts, and they have to make
decisions with less consensus.</p>
<p>This section on failure outlines how ineffective communication
happens. Identifying generic sources of difficulty is intended to help
you distinguish what is common in bureaucratic organizations versus what
is specific to the people you collaborate with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Sometimes failure to communicate is caused by too much ineffective
communication. You can get overwhelmed when there is a lot of
communication happening (whether from too many sources or too much
content). Feeling saturated with meetings, emails, phone calls, and
other coordination may stem from ineffective communication.
Communication that is incorrect, imprecise, redundant, and insufficient
can be improved. Improvement in communication effectiveness is more than
just a time saver -- poor communication yields poor negotiation. When
negotiations are not going well, the interaction defaults to an
emotional struggle of willpower.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="why-written-communication-does-not-happen">Why written communication
does not happen<span id="sec:written-comm-does-not-happen"
label="sec:written-comm-does-not-happen"></span></h3>
<p>If you can identify specific causes of why communication isn't
happening, then you can intervene and address the concerns others may
have. The following list is a set of common reasons that you can remedy
by developing a workaround or by discussing explicitly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Too many reports, emails, and messages to read and process and
respond to. Bureaucrats feel emotionally and cognitively
overwhelmed.</p></li>
<li><p>The receiving bureaucrat may read slowly.</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat-as-author may type slowly, or their handwriting is
poor.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential participants fear imperfect communication. What if the
email is incomplete or inaccurate or ambiguous?</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat views written communication as "official" or "plan
of record" and feels uncomfortable brainstorming or creating contingency
plans.</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat wants to avoid accountability for their
statements.</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat may not be confident in their writing ability --
spelling, grammar, sentence composition, structuring content.<a
href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you can identify why written communication is not happening, you
can work with the other people involved to develop creative
solutions.</p>
<p>Another source of challenge for written communication is the latency
of asynchronous interactions. By labeling distinct types of delay, you
are better equipped to respond when the issue arises.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="slowing-communication">Slowing
Communication<span id="sec:slowing-communication"
label="sec:slowing-communication"></span></h3>
<p>In an ideal scenario there would be no delay associated with
communication -- you would get the information you need when you need it.
In practice, there are various causes for why your progress is blocked
when you depend on other people.</p>
<p>Tactics that delay communication within a bureaucratic organization
are stonewalling, slow-rolling, bikeshedding, and red herrings. By
learning these concepts you will be better able to identify and then
respond to their use.</p>
<p>Stonewalling is when the recipient of a request or question doesn't
reply. There are <a href="#sec:email-responsiveness">legitimate reasons
for the lack of response</a>.</p>
<p>The person may be busy and didn't see your message, or they did see
your message but didn't have a chance to reply yet because a response to
you is lower priority than other tasks they have. You cannot
differentiate those reasonable causes from when the recipient doesn't
want to enable you to proceed. They may disagree with your objective and
see silence as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive_behavior">less
confrontational</a> than explicit rejection.</p>
<p>One way of circumventing stonewalling is to ask if the respondent is
opposed to your idea. Then a lack of response indicates no opposition.
This tactic applies if you are confident the recipient will read or hear
the message.</p>
<p>An unintentional source of stonewalling is when you ask on the wrong
channel. Sending an email may result in what appears to be stonewalling
if the person relies on chat messages or the phone. The solution for
this is feasible, but action is required by the person who doesn't
respond. The person who only uses certain channels should explicitly
indicate that. An automatic out-of-office email that says, "Contact me
by phone" tells the sender the <a
href="#sec:communication-preferences">preferred channel</a>.</p>
<p>From the view of the person doing the stonewalling, if you need time
to think or gather information before responding, tell the person who
sent a request that you acknowledge their message and will follow up in
more detail later (with a specific timeline). While better than no
response, this leads to the next challenge.</p>
<p>Slow-rolling is when you get a response to your request or question,
but the response isn't helpful. Progress is delayed because you have to
iterate to get an answer. There are valid reasons for a slow-roll and
there are uncool reasons for a slow-roll response. Perhaps the person
wants to acknowledge your request but doesn't currently have time to
provide a full explanation. The person may need to gather more
information for the complete response. Or the person is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive_behavior">passive-aggressive</a>
and may understand your question but does not want to enable your
progress.</p>
<p>The reason for a slow-roll should be made explicit by the respondent,
and a timeline for a complete response is helpful.</p>
<p>Bikeshedding is when the recipient of a question or request <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">focuses on
unimportant details relative to the primary topic</a>. Whether this
behavior is intentional or not, the best response is to refocus the
conversation on the core issue. The amount of time allocated for various
topics should be proportional to their consequence.</p>
<p>A <span data-acronym-label="red herring"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">red herring</span> response is
misleading, whether intentional or not. The respondent provides what
looks like a reasonable answer but results in unproductive work.
Occasionally there is a coincidental benefit of discovering something
unexpected, but that wasn't the respondent's intent.</p>
<p>Even though bikeshedding and a red herring can be a dark pattern,
that may not be the intent of the speaker or author. Perception matters
more than intent.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="decreased-effectiveness-in-communication-and-some-remedies">Decreased
Effectiveness in Communication and Some Remedies</h3>
<p>This section describes a few common challenges and what you can do if
you find yourself in this situation.</p>
<p><em>Challenge</em>: The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve">Allen curve</a> is an
"exponential drop in frequency of communication between engineers as the
distance between them increases."</p>
<p>Presence creates priority - go to their desk.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>I needed some data from a coworker. After trying email and phone
calls multiple times, I ended up flying across the country. Once I
arrived the person was able to provide the data in a few hours.</p>
</div>
<p>Merely sitting next to a coworker, even with no official purpose of
interaction, results in spontaneous informal discussions. See the
discussion of <a href="#sec:prisoner-exchange">Prisoner
exchange</a>.</p>
<p>Take advantage of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve">Allen curve</a> by
implementing the Inverse Conway Maneuver: if you know what interfaces a
product or process need, then design the placement of your team members
to reflect that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Challenge</em>: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws">Wiio's law</a>:
"Communication usually fails, except by accident."<br />
This pessimistic take is similar to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy's law</a> and
is indicates the level of investment needed for effective
communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Challenge</em>: Periodic status reports sent up the chain of command
get sanitized so that only good news is shared. The removal of "bad"
information impedes risk analysis.<br />
If your reports are getting sanitized, ask for a copy of the sanitized
version. If you have the responsibility for consolidating and
aggregating reports, aim for conciseness rather than good news.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Challenge</em>: Decisions by bureaucrats high in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy">chain of
command</a> are not pushed down the chain.<br />
You can request management provide a summary of their activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Challenge</em>: To assume makes an ass out of you and me, yet
assumptions are necessary to making progress in communication.<br />
You can address this dissonance by looking for sources of difference and
then talking about them. For example, when you first talk with someone
you can ask what their educational background is. You can tune your
language to their academic training if they have a different degree than
yours. You can make your story more relatable.</p>
<p>Another technique for detecting differences is to ask about the
person's previous experience. What did they work on previously in this
organization? What were their jobs before joining this organization?
This backstory can provide context for decisions that need to be made in
the current context.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="disrupting-the-path-to-failure">Disrupting
the Path to Failure</h3>
<p>To break the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner's
dilemma</a>, options are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expose all participants to the consequence of outcomes. In
practice this feels unfair to each participant because the outcome is
partially attributable to other people involved in the process. Dividing
responsibility limits exposure to consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>Have all participants communicate. In practice communication
takes time and skill. Not everyone is willing to invest since
communication is not seen as "doing the work." Accounting for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve">Allen curve</a> takes
effort. The time needed to arrive through consensus at an optimal
approach for a given situation may exceed time available for solving the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit everything to what can be accomplished by one person. This
hero-based approach is limited to the person's attention-bandwidth and
skills. As the complexity increases the necessary skills increase and
the number of candidate heroes decreases. Large organizations accomplish
complicated tasks by leveraging diverse skill-sets of teams of
bureaucrats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To break the Prisoner's Dilemma that is rampant within bureaucratic
organizations depends on recognizing the issue and identifying possible
routes. You will have to invest effort beyond what other bureaucrats are
doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The multitude of potential causes of communication failure is made more
complicated by the myriad ways individuals prefer to communicate. The
next section provides an example why of a bureaucrat might prefer one
channel over another.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.4" id="communication-preferences"><span
class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Communication Preferences<span
id="sec:communication-preferences"
label="sec:communication-preferences"></span></h2>
<p>There are typically multiple communication channels available between
bureaucrats in an organization. Rather than focus on specific
implementations using specific technologies, consider two variables. The
first variable is asynchronous versus synchronous. Examples of
asynchronous communication channels include voice mail, email, web
forums, web sites, and calendars. Synchronous options include phone
calls, video calls, in-person, text-based chat like IRC or Slack. The
distinction between asynchronous and synchronous can be blurred, like if
someone immediately replies to your (asynchronous) email. The second
variable is a set of categories: voice (e.g., phone), text (e.g.,
website, web forums, calendars), video (e.g., calls), and in-person.</p>
<p>The two variables are latency (how much delay) and bandwidth (how
much content per unit time). Any novel communication technology or
platform or service is characterized by latency and bandwidth.</p>
<p>When a communication channel has less bandwidth, there is a loss of
ability to interpret intent. For example, consider audio that has been
converted to text. In addition to the text transcription, voice audio
has inflection, volume, volume variation, rate, rate variance. Those
aspects help the audience understand the speaker better, improving the
effectiveness of communication.</p>
<p>The relevance to a bureaucrat of identifying these channels is to
know which channel is preferred for what purpose. You can list your
preferences so that people know how best to engage with you. Second, you
can learn and then leverage the preferences of people you collaborate
with.</p>
<p>As an example of knowing your behaviors, do you keep your calendar
up-to-date? Or is your calendar irrelevant? Is that preference stated
explicitly to the people who might reference your calendar? Is your
calendar visible to your coworkers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The following illustrates when to use which channel for what purpose,
and in what order.</p>
<p>Text chat is useful for asynchronous interrupts. Text chats are
better than stopping by in person or calling on the phone since
in-person drive-bys and phone calls interrupt whatever I'm thinking
about or discussing. The purpose of the text chat is either a reminder
or seeking a convenient time to talk.</p>
<p>Email is useful for notifications or questions or setting up
logistics. If I don't respond to your question or request for action
within two days, please send a reminder.</p>
<p>Video calls are my preferred method for group meetings. Group
meetings via video call scheduled in advance on my calendar are best.
Impromptu video calls are acceptable but as disruptive as a phone
call.</p>
<p>In-person discussions are my preferred method for one-on-one
discussions. Stopping by my desk without an appointment interrupts
whatever I'm thinking about. If a calendar invitation is inconvenient, a
text chat confirming my availability before the in-person discussion is
helpful.</p>
<p>Phone is useful when the caller is unable to be present in-person.
Phone, being voice-only, is inferior to video calls. Unscheduled phone
calls interrupt whatever I'm thinking about. I've intentionally disabled
voicemail.</p>
<p>Status updates in electronic issue trackers, wikis, or forums are
best (rather than email-only). Notifying in text chat or email that a
wiki page or issue is updated is helpful but not mandatory.</p>
<p>Given all those caveats, I prefer communication in any form at any
time over surprises.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether you should communicate, default to
communicating. If you're not sure whether communication would interrupt
something, check my calendar and then communicate. If it's urgent or
blocking progress, ignore my calendar and interrupt me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
You may not have the same prioritization, or you may not have as
detailed of preferences. The take-aways from the above example are that
you should know when to switch communication channels. You should know
when to start in one channel and then escalate from text to phone to
in-person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The discussion above of which channel to use is person-specific. While
bureaucracy can seem (and is designed to be) impersonal, being an
effective bureaucrat means tailoring your interactions to the people you
work with. That personalization doesn't have to stray into being
intimate friends; there's a professional capacity for vulnerability.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.5"
id="communicating-professional-sense-of-vulnerability"><span
class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Communicating Professional
Sense of Vulnerability<span id="sec:professional-vulnerability"
label="sec:professional-vulnerability"></span></h2>
<p>Emotionally vulnerable communication is personal and is a form of
intimacy. You are exposing personal issues. This personal emotional
vulnerability deepens relationships. The risk is that information could
be used to manipulate or harm. Whether you choose to form social
friendships with your coworkers is up to you, but isn't be a requirement
for an effective bureaucrat. There is a more relevant practice of
vulnerability.</p>
<p>Professional vulnerability is about going beyond transparency
regarding bureaucratic issues. Transparency is about what is happening,
while professional vulnerability is about why something is happening.
For example, professional topics of conversation include processes and
incentives. Bureaucratic processes may be intended to be impersonal, but
the consequences are felt by participants.</p>
<p>Discussions of internal intrigues of an organization are a form of
gossip among professional. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip">Gossip</a> can be
constructive (finding aspects to remedy), lead to insights, and shapes
cultural expectations within the bureaucracy. As with personal gossip,
professional gossip can risk harm if used against other organization
members.</p>
<p>As with personal vulnerability, professional vulnerability involves
learning who to share what information with when. In interacting with a
person who is new to you, you can experiment by being professionally
vulnerable and see whether they reciprocate or at least explore the
topic with you. Being open, direct, curious can help the person you're
talking with feel more comfortable. Shared introspection is the
objective.</p>
<p>As an example, you can say something like, "Perhaps the reason behind
(observation) is (reason 1) or (reason 2)." That gives the other person
a chance to brainstorm with me without committing to a position. If the
other person is unwilling to explore in depth, reverting to safer topics
is easy.</p>
<p>Being vulnerable does not mean the other person will reciprocate.
That is a risk on your part.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.6" id="communication-tips"><span
class="header-section-number">7.6</span> Communication Tips</h2>
<p>The role of verbal and written communication is critical for
bureaucrats. Bureaucracy is distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making, both of which benefit from effective coordination.</p>
<p>Plenty of advice on effective communication (e.g., enunciate, speak
loud enough to be heard, be humble, be curious) exists; the advice below
is included because of specific relevance within bureaucratic
organizations. However, the following is generic to interactions outside
of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Not all Interaction Challenges are
Communication problems</strong>.<br />
Sometimes an inability to discuss ideas is not a communication problem
but a psychological deficit of personality. Distinguishing "I'm an
ineffective communicator" from "the person I'm talking with doesn't
communicate effectively" from "that person has a diagnosed psychological
reason they are unable to communicate" is tough for those of us who are
not psychologists or psychiatrists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Avoid relying on
stereotypes</strong>.<br />
Within an organization different teams may build up reputations for
certain behaviors, or there may be significant events that the team is
associated with. When interacting with members of a team that has a
reputation, avoid relying on that stereotype or event as an opening for
discussion. You're speaking to an individual, so discuss that person's
behavior with them. Be curious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Avoid questions that have a binary
response<span id="sec:yes-no-questions"
label="sec:yes-no-questions"></span></strong>.<br />
Responding to a request with "no" is helpful for the person replying to
the question. There is less work required, less risk of failure, and
better continuity. As an example of a poorly framed question, I could
ask, "Can I have a copy of the data you're using?" The person I'm asking
is less disrupted if they refuse to share.</p>
<p>A more constructive phrasing is "I need information on X to work on
Y, and I think you have information about X. How can you help me get
information on X?" By clarifying my intent, I allow the person with the
data to provide options I may not have considered.</p>
<p>Similarly, when I'm being asked for information, I try to learn the
person's intent motivating the question. Sometimes the requester doesn't
actually know what to ask for. Instead of "no" I try to figure out how
to enable the person to be successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Leverage the other person's
experience while focusing on your own<span id="sec:advice"
label="sec:advice"></span></strong>.<br />
Advice without context is less effective.<br />
<em>Bad</em>: "Here is what I think you should do in that
situation."<br />
<em>Better</em>: "Here is what I did in that situation."</p>
<p>People usually find talking about themselves an easy topic if you are
curious about their experiences. If you can learn the other person's
background and history and motivations, you can weave that into the
advice you provide. Tailoring your message increases the likelihood of
implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Avoid Platitudes<span
id="sec:platitudes" label="sec:platitudes"></span></strong>.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platitude">Platitudes</a> are
<span data-acronym-label="thought-terminating"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">thought-terminating</span>; the
statement feels true and is resistant to debate. Platitudes capture a
feeling with sufficient accuracy, but with imprecise language. As a
result, there's no specific action.</p>
<p>Because platitudes result in a conclusion, the conversation
participants may feel more bonded. However, that bond is shallow.</p>
<p>Example platitudes to avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pick your battles.</p></li>
<li><p>Some things you can't explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Your time will come.</p></li>
<li><p>You can be anything that you want to be.</p></li>
<li><p>I just want to get through this day.</p></li>
<li><p>It is what it is.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm just one person.</p></li>
<li><p>That's that.</p></li>
<li><p>Life's not perfect.</p></li>
<li><p>Life's not fair.</p></li>
<li><p>There's only so much you can do about it.</p></li>
<li><p>What is meant to be will be.</p></li>
<li><p>It is God's will.</p></li>
<li><p>It's part of God's plan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If your goal is to understand a concept or issue deeply, you need to
use precise language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Strive to use Precise
Language</strong>.<br />
Imprecise language causes miscommunication. Intent is unclear, as is
expected consequence. Typically people get away with imprecise language
because their actions are inconsequential. Only when the consequences
matter does the problem of imprecise language manifest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Tip for Precision</em>: If you have a specific definition for a word
central to the topic of interest, ask your new collaborator for their
definition. Do not expect others to share your definition even when
there are established norms for the topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Tip for Precision</em>: Instead of asking a collaborator, "Are you
taking action on this topic?" ask "What actions are you taking on this
topic?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Tip for Precision</em>: If someone claims, "We plan to get to that
action," ask for a timeline. A deadline can be for an artifact or a
re-evaluation of the topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Imprecise language takes less cognition to create and can take less time
to convey. Thinking harder about how to precisely convey an idea takes
effort. The importance of precise language is proportional to the
potential consequences of action, inaction, or wrong action. Precision
also should be proportional to the complexity of the topic being
discussed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Word is Bond<span
id="sec:word-is-bond" label="sec:word-is-bond"></span></strong>.<br />
Your communication (verbal, written) is your reputation. People rely on
what you tell them even if there isn't legal recourse. Reliance on your
word is why precision matters.</p>
<p>Frustration and disappointment follow when you don't uphold your
word, or others misinterpret your imprecise language, or you are
misunderstood.</p>
<p>Communication implies responsibility for the content. There is a
corresponding accountability in the relationship between speaker and
listener (or writer and reader).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Take care near the Boundaries of
Knowledge</strong>.<br />
Trying to find someone else's extent of knowledge is tricky -- they don't
want to appear stupid. They may interpret the exploration at a trap. "I
don't know" can be an embarrassing statement to make, even if you don't
share their embarrassment.</p>
<p>Knowing the limitations of your knowledge and disclosing those
boundaries to others is critical. Distinguish what you know from
speculation about things you don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Listen all the way to the last word
of the speaker</strong>.<br />
Formulating a response to the first part of an idea or a sentence is
tempting. Waiting for the speaker to finish before thinking of how to
response is courteous. Waiting creates a pause which makes you seem more
thoughtful.</p>
<p>This is complicated by the speakers who include long pauses for
contemplation and then resume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Stop speaking over other people<span
id="sec:crosstalk" label="sec:crosstalk"></span></strong>.<br />
Crosstalk occurs when two people who are communicating verbally
experience interference from another audible conversation. That can
occur because a third person is talking at one of the original two
participants, or when four or more people are holding two separate
conversations concurrently.</p>
<p>Crosstalk in a bureaucracy is motivated by limited time available to
communicate. A meeting participant may feel inspired by something
someone else said and want to interject. Crosstalk can indicate
engagement and enthusiasm, or it can be due to the speaker wanting to
dominate the topic through interruption. The likelihood of crosstalk is
dependent on the level of aggressiveness of participants. In either case
(enthusiasm or power-seeking), the original speakers are disrespected.
The original speaker may feel annoyed at being interrupted.</p>
<p>The audience is frustrated by the lack of clarity of where to focus.
This distraction causes participants to lose of focus and productivity
of the interaction decreases.</p>
<p><em>Bystander intervention for an out-of-control meeting</em>: raise
your hand. This non-verbally reverts focus back to the discussion
facilitator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Account for Warnock's
dilemma</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnock%27s_dilemma">Warnock's
dilemma</a> is the common experience of figuring out how to interpret
not getting feedback. This is especially vital in meetings where the
speaker or facilitator needs to gauge participant comprehension of
delivered content. Asking "Does anyone not understand what I just
described?" is likely to get no response from attendees because
individuals want to avoid looking stupid.</p>
<p><em>Technique for getting participation</em>: Pick an individual to
provide a recap.</p>
<p><em>Technique for getting participation</em>: Survey the audience
using multiple-choice to gauge understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Seek action with a
Deadline</strong>.<br />
When asking someone for help or input, specify a deadline for their
response. This helps the person rank the urgency of their tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Make Deadlines
Explicit</strong>.</p>
<p>Typically requests have two deadlines. The first deadline is when a
response is sought. The second deadline is when a response is no longer
useful.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose I am inviting people to a meeting. I send the
invitation 5 days before the meeting and I want to know who is able to
attend by 3 days before the meeting. The second deadline is the time of
the meeting. Replies after that second deadline do not help me
understand who is going to attend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Identify the cause of
miscommunication</strong>.<br />
Letting miscommunication go uncorrected takes the least amount of work.
Left uncorrected, the same behavior is likely to happen again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Miscommunication the cause is often due to definitions of words
used or differences in context. In this situation, more time spent
communicating and taking different approaches is sufficient to remedy
the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>A speaker may be inarticulate. If the speaker is unable to
coherently convey their internal experience to a listener, then the
communication failure is of a distinct category. No amount of added
communication will lead to improved understanding on the part of the
listener.</p></li>
<li><p>A speaker has nothing to say about a subject. Regardless of
whether they are capable of articulating a concept, they may be unable
to relate to the topic. Often a person in this situation still wants to
take part, but they are unable to meaningfully contribute.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Empty talk is the use of words that are ill-defined, emotionally
resonant, inactionable, and impersonal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>ask-tell-ask</strong>.<br />
Collaborating with fellow bureaucrats who have expertise in areas you do
not requires extra work. There may be differences in the words used to
describe certain situations, more precision in wording that you're used
to, or thinking about situations in ways you are not familiar with. In
that context, to bridge the differences you can ask, tell, ask.<a
href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>The first step is asking what the other person's perspective is on
the topic. This helps establish the appropriate level of nuance is and
can tell you how that person frames the issue. The second step is to
tell the person what you want to say. The "tell" step should leverage
what you learned from the first "ask" step. Use phrasing that is
consistent with what you just learned from the other person. The third
step is to ask the person what they heard from you. If they are unable
to tell you, you may need to refine your delivery. To improve the
likelihood of success keep the content in the second step short.</p>
<p>The ask-tell-ask technique can be used iteratively in the same
conversation, especially in discussion complex topics with a new
collaborator. Using ask-tell-ask takes long than just telling but
increases the effectiveness of the communication. You also get to learn
more about the other person's perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Initial responsiveness and status
updates</strong>.<br />
In a bureaucracy requiring approval, or asking for input, sometimes
waiting can provide value to the person doing the waiting. The request
may be overcome by events, or the person asking may remind which
indicates priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Don't seek Attribution for
Contributions; Credit Others<span id="sec:credit-others"
label="sec:credit-others"></span></strong>.<br />
Give credit to others for good ideas and beneficial actions. Either they
accept credit and you are seen as a contributor to their success, or
they push back and you look generous. Credit is not a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum
game</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Offer to take Blame<span
id="sec:take-blame" label="sec:take-blame"></span></strong>.<br />
Before an action begins, tell collaborators that you are willing to
accept blame if something goes wrong. This alleviates their fear of
risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Survey Stakeholders</strong>.<br />
</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Suppose you are a <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace
Corps</a> worker in Africa. You show up and the village doesn't have
easy access to clean water. Villagers walk a long ways in dangerous
areas for dirty, unsafe water. This is an obvious problem and all the
villagers agree that they don't have good water and that this problem
should be fixed.</p>
<p>Enacting the solution would take about a week - get the equipment to
the village, drill a well, build a pump.</p>
<p>You could take more time and involve the villagers in this project.
They could participate in getting the equipment, which should lead to a
sense of ownership. But then when the equipment shows up, they don't
drill the well. If the well is drilled, it soon falls into disrepair and
the villagers are back to doing things they way they used to. What
happened?</p>
<p>The villagers don't see access to clean water as the most significant
issue. You came in and imposed your view of what the problem is and how
to fix it. When you impose your view of what the problem is, the
solution won't be adopted by villagers because they don't prioritize it.
It is better to survey the community to see how they operate. What do
they think the problems are? Both leadership and the community members
need to provide priorities.</p>
<p>This issue is exacerbated if you come to the village as a
representative of a company providing wells. You are biased when you
ask, "Do you have any problems?"</p>
<p>Of course the villagers have water problems which could be fixed with
better wells. However, when you get into the details of placing or
improving a well, they lose interest. What the community really wants is
free installation, zero maintenance, easy to use, and no operational
costs. That would improve their life.</p>
</div>
<p>When you say there's cost (both initial investment of capital and
then operations+maintenance) and a learning curve associated with the
solution, then the user's interest wanes -- you are presenting another
cost/benefit ratio for them to evaluate. Then they ask "Can we get by
without the well?" Yes, they don't need the well -- they've survived
without it.</p>
<p>Novel solutions (in this example, drilling a well and installing a
pump) have barriers to adoption. Two barriers are the current priorities
of the community and the incumbent solution or processes.</p>
<p>If there are problems with higher priority, the community will delay
enacting your solution. That's fine if the higher-ranked priorities are
bounded, but they are often not. An example of this is the following:
Suppose a person has three tasks, and you introduce a solution which is
a fourth task. If the first task is "go from point A to point B," then
that task will eventually be eliminated and there will be three
remaining. If the second task is "secure your village," that is an
unbounded task. The person won't get to or won't prioritize your
low-ranked task.</p>
<p>How will your solution impact their higher-ranked priorities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If enacting all these tips sounds like a lot of work, that's because it
is. Effective written communication requires intentional effort because
of the lack of augmenting channels (compared to voice or video or
in-person).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="summary-of-what-action-should-be-carried-out">Summary of what action
should be carried out</h3>
<p>As the outsider, you should help the community enumerate and document
all of the problems they identify. Then you can help enumerate and
document how the problems are related (dependencies). Only then can you
help the community identify and document the root causes.</p>
<p>If the solution you, the outsider, identified really is the root
cause, then the community will arrive at that independently. If that is
the case, then you can enable them to enact a solution which addresses
the root causes. The community will then have a sense of ownership.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.7" id="effective-emails-and-reports"><span
class="header-section-number">7.7</span> Effective Emails and
Reports</h2>
<p>A common misconception is that emails and reports are for
communication. To be more precise, the only true statement you can
surmise from the activity is, "I wrote something." Asynchronous
communication has no requirement of a response or action. There's no
guarantee that what you wrote has been incorporated into the audience's
mental conception of reality. That's what makes it asynchronous. Any
communication (i.e., building a shared mental model) that occurs is
merely incidental.</p>
<p>Even though emails and reports may not be ideal forms of
communication, there are other reasons they are useful to invest time
in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Written documents as notifications</em>: Email can be used to
document that you told someone something. Even if they don't read the
content, you can later point out that the information was provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Email as a task request</em>: Putting a task in another person's
shifts the responsibility. Emails in their queue may or may not be read,
and may or may not be acted upon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Just because you sent an email or filed a report, your responsibility to
communicate effectively hasn't finished. You need to confirm that the
audience has integrated the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Another reframing of emails and reports is to discard the concept of an
essay. When you learned to write in school, you were taught the essay
structure and associated conventions. Emails are not essays, and they
don't have to conform to the norms of essays. Three ways of novel ways
of thinking of emails are as a template, as art, and as a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Email is Structured</strong>: Originality is not a requirement
in bureaucratic writing. Plagiarism is acceptable. The consistency of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs">Mad Libs</a> template
is efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Email is a Piece of Art</strong>: Effort invested in each email
to improve readability means more than just careful wording. Use visual
cues (different fonts, different font sizes, highlighting, font color)
and pictures to improve readability. See figure&nbsp;<a
href="#fig:email_computer_font" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:email_computer_font">7.4</a> for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Email is a Game</strong>: Email is a game of documenting
decisions and responses so that the sequence of interactions is clear
for audits and recrimination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Your emails are not constrained to an essay-like narrative
structure.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="asynchronous-communication-responsiveness">Asynchronous
Communication Responsiveness<span id="sec:email-responsiveness"
label="sec:email-responsiveness"></span></h3>
<p>Delayed response applies to any asynchronous communication such as
voicemail, email, memos, reports. Here I'll use email, though the same
issues apply to other channels.</p>
<p>There are tiers of responsiveness, assuming the reader wants to
respond but doesn't have sufficient time available. (The explanations
below can be the other side of <span data-acronym-label="stonewalling"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">stonewalling</span> or <span
data-acronym-label="slow-rolling"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">slow-rolling</span>.)</p>
<p>Which level you are at depends on the speed of your reading, how fast
you can write, number of incoming emails, number of outgoing emails, and
how much time you allocate for email.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You are able to read all incoming emails and reply to all emails
that necessitate a response.</p></li>
<li><p>You are able to read all emails and reply to some.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only the subset that are important.</p></li>
<li><p>Only the subset that have short answers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You are unable to read all incoming emails.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Skim content of all to find relevant information, but likely to
miss some key points.</p></li>
<li><p>Read email from important people only (based on sender).</p></li>
<li><p>Search through inbox if someone needs something and cites an
email that was sent.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You have an assistant to respond to emails.</p></li>
<li><p>You have a front office team to handle messaging.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following scenarios are focused on case 2, where you are able to
triage (skim) emails but do not have enough time to respond to each.</p>
<p>In a situation where you have insufficient time, which of the
following emails do you reply to? An email from your boss, an email from
your peer, an email from a person who reports to you, or a person who
you do not know? (The ratio of these email categories is not one to one
to one to one.)</p>
<p>The email from your boss is likely the top priority. Of the remaining
emails (peer, subordinate, unknown), the peer email is likely the next
priority. The subordinate and unknown person are likely last.</p>
<p>The consequence of triage is that when there's insufficient time
available, your transparency to subordinates and unknown people is
likely to decrease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Let's consider another scenario requiring triage of email. Three emails
come in. One has no action, one is easy to reply to, and the third is
difficult and takes time. Which one gets the response? As with the
previous scenario, the ratio of these inbound emails is not one to one
to one.</p>
<p>The email that is easy to reply to gets answered first. The email
that is difficult is second. If you only have time for one of the
emails, it's likely to be the easy one. This is an example of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_aversion">ambiguity
aversion</a>. As a consequence, outsiders see this as you demonstrating
bikeshedding; also known as the <a

<p>Whether you are the only recipient or one of many receivers can
change the intent of the email. Whether you are in the "to" or "cc"
field matters. Unfortunately, "to" versus "cc" are not reliable
indicators since email senders do not reliably conform to the expected
use.</p>
<p>An email sent to multiple recipients may have different purposes for
different readers. The reader's role or knowledge may factor into how

<p>Reading each email is burdensome. If you don't have time to read

skimming can lead to problematic behavior. First you scan the text of a
message to see if there is immediate action or response needed. If no
action or response is needed, go to the next email. That may not work
for emails that have logistics associated with future events, or emails
that alter your perception of the situation.</p>
<p>If you read an email to figure out the purpose of the email, that
will help determine what action and response are relevant. Here I'm
using "action" to refer to activities outside the email channel.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.8" id="meetings-are-bureaucratic"><span
class="header-section-number">7.8</span> Meetings are Bureaucratic<span
id="sec:meetings" label="sec:meetings"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is distributed decision-making and distributed knowledge
associated with management of shared resources. Bureaucrats rely on a
variety of mechanisms to communicate, one of which is a meeting with
other bureaucrats.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Every participant in an organization is invested the outcome of every
decision made because there is consequence to how resources are divided
and the direction of the organization. Every bureaucrat has an opinion,
even when lacking experience or expertise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="financial-models-of-communication">Financial
models of communication<span id="sec:financial-models-of-communication"
label="sec:financial-models-of-communication"></span></h3>
<p>This section analyzes communication from a financial perspective,
focusing on two observations: being late to a meeting is theft, and
poorly written email and email to the wrong people has financial cost.
The point of raising these is to enable comparison with other
investments the organization makes. Creating a cost model can help
determine how much effort into improving what might otherwise seem like
cultural issues.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="meeting-time-compared-to-theft">Meeting time
compared to theft</h4>
<p>In large organizations there can be significant bureaucracy
associated with even small purchases. A multi-step review process may be
incurred for a $200 acquisition. (Typically the cost of the review
process in terms of person-hours spent isn't part of the calculus.)</p>
<p>Another measurement of value is that if an employee were to steal
even $200 worth of materials, the organization would likely punish that
employee.</p>
<p>In the book High Output Management&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove 1995)</span>, Grove points out that those
metrics apply to tangible goods, but not to people's time. Consider a
meeting of 10 people and each person's cost is $200 per hour. A wasted
meeting is not unusual and would not incur bureaucratic review
processes. The cost to the organization is fiscally the same -- $2000.
Similarly, consider an employee who is late and causes a loss of
productivity. Merely depriving the organization of $200 worth of time is
not punished in the same way theft is.</p>
<p>In fact, organizations default to meetings (even recurring meetings)
rather than not meet. And being late (by a few minutes) to a meeting is
commonly accepted.</p>
<p>We can debate the differences between theft of materials and theft of
time. The financial argument is they are indistinguishable.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="email-is-not-free">Email is not free</h4>
<p>Bureaucracy as distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making
requires communication. Because synchronous communication like phone
calls, video calls, and in-person meetings is challenging to coordinate,
written communication is widely used for asynchronous collaboration.
Whether that written content is emails or text-based chat, writing is
expensive.</p>
<p>The cost of email includes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time spent writing (authorship).</p></li>
<li><p>Time spent reading (readership).</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure maintenance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those three factors can be quantified as variables. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{gathered}
\text{Cost per email} =
(\text{hourly rate of writer})*(\text{time spent writing}) +\\
(\text{hourly rate of reader})*(\text{time spent reading})*(\text{number
of readers})+\\
\frac{\text{annual salary of maintainer}}{\text{number of emails per
year}} + \frac{\text{email server cost}}{\text{number of emails per
year}}\end{gathered}\]</span> Plugging in some numbers, suppose an
author charging $50 per hour spends 5 minutes writing an email to 4
people. Each of those four people also charge $50 per hour and spends 2
minutes on reading. <span class="math display">\[50*(5/60) + 50*(2/60)*4
+ \frac{100000}{1000000} + \frac{10000}{1000000} = \$10.84
\label{eq:four_readers}\]</span> The cost to the organization is $11 for
one email! The breakdown of the three variables is shown in Figure&nbsp;<a
href="#fig:my_label" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:my_label">7.6</a>. You've probably sent and received
more than one email in your professional career as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>If the cost of one email doesn't lead you to be careful with
communication, consider the cost to the organization of communication.
If email consumes 2 hours a day per person (reading and writing), and if
staffing is 50% of the organizations budget, then 12.5% of the
organization's budget is spent on email. The same math for applies to
meetings, so with 2 hours of meeting and 2 hours of email that's 25% of
the organization's budget on coordination.</p>

<p>Being an effective bureaucrat means leveraging the distributed
knowledge present on your team and in your organization. Explaining how
to run an effective meeting (the scope of this section) is easy compared
to the work of implementing those techniques. The extra work required to
facilitate an effective meeting means the default of unproductive
discussions is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash
equilibrium</a>. So we all sit in ineffective meetings. You can choose
to take action that disrupts the equilibrium. The positive view of that
action is that you can serve as a role model and demonstrate behaviors
of other people can learn from. The negative view is that you are
relieving the need for other people to do work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Most bureaucratic meetings lack the formality and structure covered by
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order">Robert's
Rules of Order</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> The level of formality for meetings
in bureaucratic organizations varies widely. Most commonly bureaucrats
rely on personal relationships and social norms in meetings of less than
15 people. In that context there are tips for effective interactions.
Although many of these may seem obvious, each of them requires extra
work.</p>

<p><em>Meeting suggestion</em>: <strong>Form relationships and

</div>
<p>If you don't have relationships or if the topics are a surprise to

<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Meeting suggestion</em>: <strong>Don't invite
everyone</strong>.<br />
This may seem counter-intuitive since bureaucracy is about coordination,
but having too many attendees wastes the time of people who have no
input on the issue. To identify essential attendees you need to think
ahead about which decisions are going to be made and who has the
authority to make a decision. If someone does not need to be present,
tell them in advance that you will share the meeting notes afterwards.

<p><em>Meeting suggestion</em>: <strong>Facilitator's ground
rules</strong>.<br />
To run a smooth and productive meeting, I explicitly state two ground
rules to the attendees:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want to talk, raise your hand and I will call on you. If
there are multiple people wanting to talk, I'll track the order of
speakers.</p></li>
<li><p>If you talk too long, I'll cut you off.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach is critical when there are many people present, when
people with diverse backgrounds are present, or when there is a mixture
of dominant and submissive personalities present. If a visual signal
like hand raising is not used, reliance on verbal interruption defaults
to dominant personalities. Waiting for a person to finish speaking
doesn't work for everyone because some participants will use more than
their fair share of time. speaking for a long time needs to be addressed
regardless of whether an intentional effort to exclude others or a
consequence of verbosity.</p>
<p>As a facilitator, my focus is on structure (distinct phases of the
discussion) and ensuring participation. I remove myself from taking part
in the discussion.</p>
<p>The facilitator does not need to share all their guardrails with
participants. You should have a structure in mind before starting the
meeting. For example,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Establish understanding of what the topic is. Without a shared
focus and a common goal a meeting is unlikely to be productive.</p></li>
<li><p>Set aside topics that are not the focus. Either discuss outside
the current meeting or defer to a later meeting. Managing scope is
critical to accomplishing the goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a shared language specific to the topic and to the
participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish each participant's viewpoint on the topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Brainstorm options.</p></li>
<li><p>Build consensus or nominate a decider.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Meeting suggestion</em>: <strong>Facilitate Asking Dumb Questions
without Feeling Intimidated</strong>.<br />
Asking a question of an expert from a position of ignorance can feel
intimidating. You may worry you're wasting the expert's time. In a
recurring meeting a facilitator can address this by having participants
write questions on paper and submitting anonymously. The questions or
discussion topics can then be raised at following meetings.</p>
</div>
<p>To facilitate the anonymity every participant must be given paper and
pen, and every participant must write something on the paper. The
facilitator then has to collect the paper from each participant. For
contributors who don't have a question, they can write down feedback
about the meeting.</p>
<p>This technique allows the expert to get the information needed for a
response, or to figure out who the best person to respond is.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="characterizing-meetings">Characterizing
Meetings<span id="sec:characterizing-meetings"
label="sec:characterizing-meetings"></span></h3>
<p>Characterizing meetings is critical to distinguishing which norms are
applicable, and what people expect from the different formats.</p>
<p>Meetings can be categorized as internal meetings, customer meetings,
conferences, <a href="#sec:meetings-one-on-one">scheduled
one-on-ones</a>, or <a href="#sec:walk-arounds">impromptu
walk-arounds</a>. These are easy to label and participants agree on the
labels. A more important framing is to evaluate the potential purposes
of a meeting. The relevance of this approach is that sometimes
participants in a meeting wouldn't agree about the purpose (if that
question as raised) and sometimes the purpose of a meeting evolves
during the meeting.</p>
<p>Standard reasons bureaucrats have to create a meeting include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To gather input from attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>To make a pronouncement to attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>To educate attendees. Formally labeled as a training course, but
often makes an appearance in meetings that weren't initially intended to
be educational.</p></li>
<li><p>To educate one person. Especially important if the personal
lacking context is the decision-maker.</p></li>
<li><p>To signal interaction. Participants in these meetings can say
they met with other stakeholders, but that doesn't imply value was
generated.</p></li>
<li><p>To brainstorm ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>To make progress towards an goal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the purpose is not explicitly stated, confusion arises. When
multiple purposes occur in one meeting and the transition is not
explicitly stated, confusion arises. The reason for this confusion is
that the assumptions and expectations and norms of each purpose are
different. When the attendees don't know the purpose or the purpose
shifts, the expected behaviors and roles are unclear.</p>
<p>An attendee can ask what the purpose of the meeting is during the
meeting but that is generally considered rude. An attendee can try to
deduce the purpose of a meeting, but this takes time and attention and
can result in the wrong conclusion. An attendee can try to set the
purpose of the meeting during the meeting, but this can conflict with
the intent of other attendees.</p>
<p>A meeting's purpose can shift during a meeting. If done
intentionally, the changes should be stated explicitly. Otherwise an
attendee may continue to work under the previous set of expectations
rather than the current norms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Level of formality, start time (early or on time or late), end time
(early or on time or late), utility, duration, number of attendees,
number of speakers, and number of participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Meetings involve people, either known or strangers. Meetings involve
information, either relevant or irrelevant. Relevant information is
either new or related to previous work. Meetings either have a leader or
no leader (e.g., team brainstorming). If there's a leader, the leader
may be disseminating information to participants or gathering
information from attendees.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="walk-around-impromptu-meetings">Walk-around
impromptu meetings<span id="sec:walk-arounds"
label="sec:walk-arounds"></span></h3>
<p>Meetings aren't constrained to occur in conference rooms around a
table with everyone seated. Walking around the shared office space and
having conversations with coworkers can be an intentional form of
informal meeting.</p>
<p>Ambushing coworkers when they aren't expecting interruption takes
tact. As the (potential) interrupter, you need to be sensitive that
other people may not want to be interrupted, while others seek diversion
from their current task. If you're the person being interrupted by the
coworker walking around, you have the right of deferral.</p>
<p>Walking around and finding people to talk with can be for <a
href="#sec:socializing">social engagement</a> or to discuss tasks you
are working on. In either case, you are interrupting existing
activities. Presence creates priority, whether intentional or
accidental.</p>
<p>This concept isn't new. In the American Revolution, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_von_Steuben">Baron
von Steuben</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George
Washington</a> used walk-around meetings to understand the needs of the
members of their army.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="one-on-one-check-in-meetings">One-on-one
check-in meetings<span id="sec:meetings-one-on-one"
label="sec:meetings-one-on-one"></span></h3>
<p>In contrast to the ambush of a walk-around, formal one-on-one
meetings are typically a planned interaction between a supervisor and a
team member. These discussions can be mutually beneficial. The meeting
is an opportunity for the supervisor to coach the team member and for
the supervisor to learn what the problems are on the team. From the team
member's perspective, a one-on-one is an opportunity to ensure alignment
with the team's direction and provide insight on how to improve the
team. There can be education in both directions.</p>
<p>When a supervisor oversees multiple team members, holding one-on-ones
can take a lot of time. With ten team members and an hour every other
week, that's 12.5% of the supervisor's time without counting prep and
documenting the discussion outcomes. There's a risk that the mindset
becomes "no news is good news" or "everything is going well, no need to
engage." The consequence of that minimal mode is that only <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagull_management">negative
feedback causes interaction</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A constructive check-in requires forethought for both the supervisor and
the team members. For one-on-one meetings there are generic questions
that can help the supervisor understand the team member's status.</p>
<p>A supervisor should ask the team member questions <a href="#fn58"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What have you been successful with since we last met?</p></li>
<li><p>What is blocking our team's progress?</p></li>
<li><p>What are your plans?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you collaborating with the rest of the team?</p></li>
<li><p>If you could change one thing about our organization, what would
it be and why?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you plan to train your coworkers on topics you understand
and they don't?</p></li>
<li><p>What have you learned in the past month?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the biggest risks for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>What's limiting your productivity?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Responding to these questions takes time (an hour) and a willingness
to be open.</p>
<p>If the supervisor doesn't ask these questions, the team member can
include them in the agenda and bring them up.</p>
<p>Preparation for the one-on-one is a shared responsibility. The
supervisor can review notes from the previous discussion and any
artifacts that have been in progress. Before the meeting, the team
member should document responses to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What was discussed previously?</p></li>
<li><p>What progress has been made since the previous meeting?</p></li>
<li><p>What is blocking progress?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The generic questions above may not fit all situations, like when a
new bureaucrat joins an existing team. The one-on-one check-in should be
tailored to the phase of the employee's progression. Frequency of
check-ins depends on the newness of the team member, the complexity of
the work, or how quickly the conditions are changing.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Welcome to the team!</u><br />
<em>Scenario: New team member, either new to the team or new to the
organization.</em><br />
Here the focus of the one-on-one is to ensure a smooth onboarding
process. Get them up-to-speed on the technical challenges, professional
norms, and integrated with other team members. Resolve administrative
blockers like the following: Does the employee have the necessary
computer log-in accounts? Do they have an email account? Are they on the
mailing list?<br />
<em>Questions you can ask</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the goals for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>What items on the onboarding checklist are not yet
completed?</p></li>
<li><p>Who have you met on the team? What is your understanding of their
role on the team?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The duration of this phase could last between a day and two
weeks.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Initial contributions</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Team member handles small tasks.</em><br />
The purpose of this one-on-one is for discussions on training, planning,
task reviews. This phase is characterized by the team member being
dependent on others for their success. In this phase the employee
collaborates on tasks.<br />
<em>Questions you can ask</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the goals for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>What are your task goals?</p></li>
<li><p>What are you expecting to deliver to the team? When?</p></li>
<li><p>What dependencies does that deliverable have (external to the
team or internal to the team)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The duration of this phase could last a few months to
years.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Experienced contributor</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Team member handles large tasks (which they break into
subtasks).</em><br />
The purpose of this one-on-one is to help the team member define their
success. Activities include planning, resource allocation, and
assessment. This phase is characterized by the need to coordinate with
others on the team or other teams. Team member understands task scope
and intent and relevant processes. Team member decomposes task into
subtasks.<br />
<em>Questions you can ask</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do the artifacts you're working on support your plan for the
team's progress?</p></li>
<li><p>What dependencies does that deliverable have (external to the
team or internal to the team)?</p></li>
<li><p>What insights do you have about the team or
organization?</p></li>
<li><p>What insights do you have about the relevance of the task
relative to the purpose of the organization?</p></li>
<li><p>What should management be doing to enable the team's
success?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The duration of this phase could be the rest of a
career.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Facilitator</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Facilitating the productivity of others.</em><br />
Rather than being task-oriented, this team member supports
coworkers.<br />
<em>Questions you can ask</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What observations from mentoring team members do you
have?</p></li>
<li><p>What collaborations should we be fostering?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Peer</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Peer check-in.</em><br />
This one-on-one is a form of mentorship. The value of the exchange is to
get a different perspective and to hold each other accountable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To evaluate when a team member and their supervisor should move to
the next phase in the evolution, have an explicit conversation about the
threshold for progression.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="listening-to-bad-presentations">Listening to
Bad Presentations<span id="sec:bad-presentations"
label="sec:bad-presentations"></span></h3>
<p>Occasionally you attend a meeting with a bad presentation. The slides
may appear slick but the content is poorly thought out. Or the presenter
does not understand the topic well. Or the presenter has good content
but does not convey it well. Or the presenter is wrong about the topic.
Regardless of the cause, you should assume the presenter is making their
best effort.</p>
<p>You could remain silent, complain, criticize, ask leading questions,
or offer constructive feedback. Your silence may result in other
attendees and the presenter leaving with incomplete or wrong
information. If you speak up you'll prolong the meeting or limit the
presenter's time to convey their material.</p>
<p>Your assessment of the presentation may be wrong. You may lack
relevant information. A reliable technique for interjection is to assume
a state of confusion instead of confidently asserting that the presenter
is wrong. If you believe the presenter is wrong, asking about the source
of their information is a good entry point.</p>
<p>You should ask for clarification when the information is correct but
presented poorly (or above the level you understand).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
By paying attention to a bad presentation, you can identify issues that
you do not want to repeat. The next section summarizes a few insights so
you don't need to learn from bad presentations.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="make-effective-presentations">Make Effective
Presentations<span id="sec:effective-presentations"
label="sec:effective-presentations"></span></h3>
<p>Speaking is vital at decision points in your career progress -- at
interviews, competitions, gaining new collaborators at conferences.
Because you want to avoid mistakes in those situations, you will need to
prepare and practice. Aim to impress your peers, supervisors, and
subordinates.</p>
<p>Breaking down the variables of your presentation can help identify
questions to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: What's your goal? What does your
audience want? Are those aligned?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scope</strong>: What is the minimum information you need
to convey your point, while balancing that against the need to provide
sufficient evidence of your claims?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Audience</strong>: What's their background? What are they
seeking? What are they expecting?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speaker</strong>: What should your appearance be? Do you
need to alter your normal enunciation, volume, or rate?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slides</strong>: What is the layout of your content?
What's the content?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Props</strong>: Are there artifacts that demonstrate the
point of your presentation?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Venue</strong>: How big is the room? What technology is
available? How is the lighting? Will you be competing with a noise
source? Other visual distractions?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time</strong>: How much time do you have to prepare? Do
you have access to the venue before the event? How much time do you have
for presentation? For questions?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Expanding on the question of purpose for your talk, a standard
framing is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Heilmeier%23Heilmeier&#39;s_Catechism">Heilmeier's
Catechism</a>. Heilmeier's list of questions is concise enough to be
memorable, but skips some relevant aspects. The list I recommend
reflecting on builds on the original set:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(Heilmeier asks) What are you trying to do? Articulate your
objectives using absolutely no jargon.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Should the solution be technical, social, or a process?</p></li>
<li><p>Which aspects are quantifiable and which are
qualitative?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(Heilmeier asks) How is it done today, and what are the limits of
current practice?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How did we get to the current situation?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(Heilmeier asks) What's new in your approach and why do you think
it will be successful?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What has been tried before? Why did those efforts not
succeed?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(Heilmeier asks) Who cares? If you're successful, what difference
will it make?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Who are the stakeholders? What involvement do you expect from
each stakeholder?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(Heilmeier asks) What are the risks and the payoffs?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the constraints?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(Heilmeier asks) How much will [each milestone] cost?</p></li>
<li><p>(Heilmeier asks) How long will [each milestone] take?</p></li>
<li><p>What skills are needed for each milestone?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you know that set of constraints is correct?
Complete?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(Heilmeier asks) What are the midterm and final "exams" to check
for success?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Who is evaluating the milestone artifacts?</p></li>
<li><p>What will be measured to determine the success of each
milestone?</p></li>
<li><p>You should pre-register what counts as failure to enable
accountability.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the questions above, another way to think ahead is the
sequential tasks associated with the presentation. The following can
serve as a checklist.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="planning-your-presentation">Planning your
presentation</h4>
<p>Evaluate your audience's experience and education prior to creating
the presentation. The question you are addressing in your presentation
may be independent of the audience, but the level of delivery depends on
the audience's background.</p>
<p>When speaking to an audience outside your field, aim to use jargon
your audience is familiar with. Another tactic is to look for areas of
commonality and then build on that.</p>
<p>In introducing your topic, there are a few ways to open the talk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compliment</strong> the audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Humor</strong>: tell a relevant joke.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: Tell how this work makes you
feel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers</strong>: Explain context and relevance in terms
of money, number of people involved, and size of the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare the content:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tell a coherent story with a unified theme. Each slide should be
logically connected to the following slide. Don't just put a bunch of
slides with data or pictures together. You risk disorienting your
audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Run spell check before presenting.</p></li>
<li><p>Translate your slides from your native language to the language
of your audience.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the visual content in presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Switching between dark and light slides in a dark room stresses
the eyes. The audience needs time to adjust to varying light
levels.</p></li>
<li><p>In figures, use both color contrast and distinct symbols to deal
with colorblind audiences. See also <a
href="http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/">http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Making slides appear "professional" means adding
non-informational content. This added content should be consistent, not
distracting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Common choices include LaTeX(specifically <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)">beamer</a>),
Microsoft <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint">PowerPoint</a>,
and Apple's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software)">Keynote</a>.
You are sending a few messages to your audience if you use Microsoft
Word, a document PDF, notepad, or any other non-presentation software to
make a presentation. First, the audience isn't worth the time you needed
to develop a proper presentation, and second, you are not technically
savvy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Live demos can invigorate a boring presentation. Besides the
interactivity aspect, the audience is excited by the risk of technical
failure. If you plan to give a live demo, have screenshots of the
process in the presentation. That way, if the demo fails you can show
what was supposed to happen in the slides. If the demo works, skip the
slides.</p>
<p>Practice the presentation (out loud in real-time) at least once. Use
the setup as close to reality as possible for practice sessions. Project
onto the screen using the projector. This experiment will show if the
color contrast is sufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Questions to ask your host:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Will I have a projector and screen for the presentation?</p></li>
<li><p>For the technology I'm using (PowerPoint, PDF, Keynote), which
version is provided? Or does the speaker bring their own computer? Or is
there internet access?</p></li>
<li><p>How to best get the presentation content to the host? Bring a USB
drive or laptop, or email the presentation file to the host?</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="day-of-talk">Day of talk</h4>
<p>Appearance (suit and tie or jeans and t-shirt?):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Underdressed = I don't respect the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Overdressed = I'm better than you.</p></li>
<li><p>Similar level of dress = I'm a peer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Some of these suggestions should seem glaringly obvious. They are here
because I have seen them in "official" presentations given by a
"professional." For example, do not curse. No profanity while speaking,
in the slide presentation, or even the name of the file.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="before-the-talk-begins">Before the talk
begins</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure your facility has power, a screen, a projector, a pointer,
and any other necessary equipment. (Don't rely on your host to think of
these things for you.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all equipment works and functions together.</p></li>
<li><p>Before the presentation begins, use a slide to make announcements
and reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>List the agenda if there are multiple speakers.</p></li>
<li><p>Time talk begins, how long it will last.</p></li>
<li><p>Reminder: Turn OFF Cell Phones. Airplane mode is insufficient
since previously set alarms can ring.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Announce whether to ask questions during the talk (i.e., the
audience should interrupt) or to hold questions until done.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="during-the-talk">During the talk</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Opening: Thank hosts, inviters, and organizers. Establish a
connection between you (the speaker) and the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not pace.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not stand frozen.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are the only person laughing at your joke, it isn't
funny.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="end-of-your-presentation">End of Your
Presentation</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Let the person asking the question finish. Even if you think you
know what they are going to ask, wait.</p></li>
<li><p>Restate the question to make sure the audience heard it and that
you understood it.</p></li>
<li><p>Aim for shorter responses. Save your longer answer for a
follow-up discussion after the audience has been released.</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>Because bureaucratic policies and processes seem convoluted, let's
start from a more relatable point: your personal habits. You might eat
at the same time every day, or you might go to bed at the same time.
Those are both examples of personal policies. Sticking to a routine
decreases the need to think about options. In the same way, bureaucrats
in organizations seek routines to decrease uncertainty.</p>
<p>You have experience with creating and using personal policies (your
habits). Bureaucratic processes for organizations are similar. Both are
routines which ease the burden of decision-making. A habit can be
intentional (e.g., my policy is to brush my teeth before going to bed),
just as a process can be designed. Habits can be unconscious (e.g.,
arriving at work without recalling driving there), just as processes can
arise without an intentional design.</p>
<p>Consider your intentional habits -- they are likely motivated by a
personal policy. Similarly, bureaucrats acting on behalf of an
organization apply processes that support policies of the
organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The sections of this chapter address the <a
href="#sec:definition-of-process">what</a>, <a
href="#sec:why-processes-exist">why</a>, and <a
href="#sec:process-chaos">how</a> of processes. The last sections of
this chapter (<a href="#sec:design-of-processes">design</a> and <a
href="#sec:change-a-process">change</a>) assume a level of control and
autonomy that you may not think of you have. Regardless of where your
role is in the hierarchy, your purpose is to provide value to the
organization. That value can be negotiation with fellow bureaucrats on
improvements to the design of task workflows.</p>
<p>The foundation of your <span data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span> is based on
the sections in this chapter, whereas previous chapters have been
focused on your skills as a bureaucrat.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.1" id="why-do-processes-exist"><span
class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Why do Processes Exist?<span
id="sec:why-processes-exist"
label="sec:why-processes-exist"></span></h2>
<p>The following sections explain why organizations rely on <span
data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">processs</span>. The reasoning matters
to you in your role as a bureaucrat when you design a process or try to
revise an existing process. Similarly, as a person going through a
process, the reasoning below explains why you are experiencing <span
data-acronym-label="process friction"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process friction</span>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-enable-consistent-application-of-policy">Processes Enable
Consistent Application of Policy</h3>
<p>Organizations are intended to be insensitive to individual
participants. That de-personalization applies to both bureaucrats and
subjects. In practice there is sensitivity to who the bureaucrat is and
who the subject is.</p>
<p>Processes address risk to the allocated resource and risk to the
bureaucrats carrying out the process. Use of processes address the risk
of both current bad behavior and the potential of things going bad in
the future. Process is the guardrail limiting harm to bureaucrats and
the shared resource.</p>
<p>One motive for bureaucracy is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy of
the commons</a>, which says that when there is a shared resource someone
will try to get away with behavior that is harmful to the community of
users. Limiting harmful behavior can take the form of oversight
processes. If oversight processes are not in place malicious actors
dominate.</p>
<p>Another example guardrail is keeping stakeholders informed
(justifications) so that intervention can be taken if needed.</p>
<p>Each process for oversight, review, or approval may be justifiable
when evaluated in isolation, but the aggregate can feel unreasonably
burdensome to both subjects and bureaucrats.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="processes-enable-simplification">Processes
Enable Simplification</h3>
<p>Compared to an ad hoc approach, processes are intended to simplify
what could otherwise be complicated moral decisions, complex
coordination challenges, or financial assessments.</p>
<p>The relation between complexity of a task and skill of the
bureaucratic workforce is another motive for the creation of processes.
A positive story is that specialization allows narrow focus and thus
deeper understanding and skill. An alternative perspective is that
specialization allows for dumbing down the role, thus enabling a cheaper
workforce. See figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:complexity-and-size"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:complexity-and-size">3.1</a> for a visualization of
the trade-off.</p>
<p>Applying a process allows dumb individuals to do complicated things.
The collective talent exceeds that of any individual. As a specific
example, consider the process of designing and building a car. That
complexity is feasible to undertake for a skilled and knowledgeable
individual, but the cheaper approach is to hire individuals capable of
installing the passenger-side doors in an assembly line.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-enable-increased-throughput">Processes Enable Increased
Throughput</h3>
<p>Processes that leverage specialization can improve scalability. Adam
Smith's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process#Adam_Smith">pin
factory example</a> cites a productivity gain of 240x. Similarly, the
introduction of moving assembly lines in Ford's car factory produced an
8x improvement of throughput.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>While social processes may work well for low-volume ad-hoc requests,
formalized bureaucratic processes become necessary for recurring
high-volume activities.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-enable-less-reliance-on-social-relations">Processes Enable
less Reliance on Social Relations</h3>
<p>The relation between bureaucratic processes and social bonds was
noted by Selznick in his 1943 paper&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1943_Selznick">(Selznick 1943)</span>. The needs of
individual members of an organization may be at odds with (or at least
not aligned with) the purpose of the organization. This dissonance is
observed as the interplay between personal relationships and
bureaucratic processes.</p>
<p>Generalizing claims about social bonds in an organization is
unfounded. For a given complexity and given scale, there are people who
are more social and less social and therefore desire more or less
process. There are bureaucrats who want documented processes and are
confused as to how things are operating when those aren't present.</p>
<p>The invisibility of social relationships limits bureaucrats not
attuned to the importance of these bonds. Social influence among
bureaucrats lacks transparency-- discoverability and documentation. In
contrast, processes are easier to understand and to track. The counter
to social influence is the hierarchical <span
data-acronym-label="org chart" data-acronym-form="singular+short">org
chart</span>. Social influence is not antithetical to processes. There's
always a mixture of the two.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-enable-new-bureaucrats-and-subjects">Processes Enable New
Bureaucrats and Subjects</h3>
<p>Bureaucrats new to a team are likely to ask, "What are the processes
and where is the documentation?" Bureaucrats who have been on a team for
a long time say, "Don't burden me with processes, I just need to get
things done using the relationships with the people I have." One motive
for processes is to help with onboarding team members who don't have
relationships available.</p>
<p>Besides not having formed a social network, there's a second reason
new people seek processes. New team members who recently graduated from
school are used to the existence of formal processes at the high school
or university level. Therefore when they join a job, they expect a
similar set of conditions for processes to exist and follow.</p>
<p>Once this motive for processes is recognized, the relevance when
onboarding new hires is apparent. New hires will need to discover the
existing processes while they form social bonds. Discovering processes
comes through oral folklore or written documentation. To augment both
process discovery and creation of relationship, one technique is to have
new hires sit with experienced team members. This is described in the
section on <a href="#sec:prisoner-exchange">Prisoner exchange</a>. Where
you sit matters to your effectiveness as a bureaucrat.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="processes-enable-promotion">Processes Enable
Promotion</h3>
<p>Processes can arise organically (bottom up) or be created top-down.
In either context, creating a new process counts as bureaucratic
innovation. Process creation is confused as being worthy of promotion
because of the lack of distinction between novelty and innovation. Real
innovation incurs risk, whereas new processes are merely novel. Both
cause change, but processes are typically designed to decrease risk.
Rewarding decreased risk is reasonable, but it shouldn't be labeled as
innovation.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.2" id="riding-the-chaos"><span
class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Riding the Chaos<span
id="sec:process-chaos" label="sec:process-chaos"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations are imperfect because they are composed of
humans. A bureaucratic organization is a complex and chaotic
environment.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> An understandable response is to
impose processes and hierarchy and roles. Imposing structure can feel
intellectually fulfilling and emotionally satisfying. Imposing structure
looks like progress and may even help with your promotion in the
hierarchy. The challenge (or continual source of employment) is that
chaos is dynamic. A process created in response to chaos create new
challenges and is disrupted by changes in number of staff, changes to
who is part of the process, changes to amount of work. The half-life of
structure depends on the rate of change of tasking and the rate of <a
href="#sec:turnover">personnel turn-over</a>.</p>
<p>A bureaucrat in the organization could strive for perfection, run
away from the chaos (to something less chaotic), exploit the chaos, or
adopt an attitude of "I do what I can" or "I'll wait out the problem."
Another option, and the focus of this section, is to build skills for
navigating the chaos of a bureaucratic organization.</p>
<p>You can build and maintain your network of professionally connections
with fellow bureaucrats. This augments the chain of command of a
hierarchy. There is a turn-over in both hierarchical roles and in your
professional network, so you need to continually invest effort in
creating new bonds and maintain existing relations.</p>
<p>You can see change as an opportunity for improvement rather than a
destruction of your previous investments. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">sunk cost fallacy</a>
applies both to your emotional state and the resources you invested.
Fear of change is understandable -- it disrupts the comfort of stability
and known processes. Anticipating change and preparing for it eases the
stress of change.</p>
<p>You can leverage personalities and unique traits rather than
expecting everyone to be interchangeable and treating differences as
flaws. By knowing the strengths, interests, and weaknesses of coworkers
you can facilitate the process of change.</p>

<p>Bureaucratic processes require working with other people. One source
of friction is that participants may lack familiarity with the
process.</p>
<p>This observation can be quantified with a small number of
assumptions. The distribution of team membership tenure might fit a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law
distribution</a> <a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> -- there are more inexperienced
people than experienced people. What matters in this context is how long
the team member has been in their role (rather than how long they've
been a member of the organization). Let's assume a max tenure of ten
years.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> If the process involves five
people, the least experienced member will have a median 100 calendar
days of experience.</p>

<p>Three calendar months (or 70 business days) may be inadequate for
complex processes or processes that are infrequent (quarterly or
annual), especially if there was no training. When the number of

participant is 51 calendar days (37 business days).</p>

To recap, the assumption made were</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Random independent sampling of organization members.</p></li>
<li><p>Tenure in role matters, not tenure in organization. (This
assumption excludes transfer learning among roles.)</p></li>
<li><p>Tenure in role fits power law distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>The power law distribution is characterized by (a=5, max
tenure=10 years).</p></li>
<li><p>There are 5 people involved in the process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If that last parameter is varied, the estimate of 3 months as the
median is reasonable for processes with 5 or more participants.</p>

class="header-section-number">8.4</span> Automating Processes<span
id="sec:automating-processes"
label="sec:automating-processes"></span></h2>
<p>For bureaucratic organizations that deal with intangibles (referred
to as "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge
work</a>"), the desire to automate processes is wide-spread. (When
physical objects are involved, then robotics is necessary for
automation.) Automation has the benefits of consistency, predictability,
decreased labor costs, and easier trouble-shooting.</p>
<p>While benefits of automation are known to participants, there are
barriers to automation you will need to address. As with making
information discoverable and searchable, automation require investment
of time, money, and skills that are ancillary to the purpose of the
organization. A transition of manual processes to automated workflows
require doing the original work while enabling automation. Creating the
conditions that are needed for automation have a delayed pay-off.</p>
<p>The evolution of automating a process involves</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Identify who is involved in the process. How did the process get
created and how has it evolved up to now? Who evaluates success of the
process?</p></li>
<li><p>For existing processes, transition verbal folklore to written
documentation. The purpose of this step is to write down the workflow
and business logic and relevant decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Transition the documentation in the previous step from plain text
documentation to structured data. Examples of structured text that can
be parsed by a computer include decision trees and workflow diagrams.
Implementation could be in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz">Graphviz</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint">PowerPoint</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect metrics (for example, number of times software
application was opened, how frequently the folder was reviewed, how much
time was spent on the webpage) for existing manual processes to enable
cost evaluation for implementing automation. This is the modern version
of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_motion_study">time
and motion study</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Implement stand-alone software (scripts) for each task using
personal automation tools like <a
href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyAutoGUI</a> or <a
href="https://www.autoitscript.com/site/">AutoIt</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Tie the scripts in the previous step to the task workflows from
step 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Create an automation assistant that actively monitors your
activities (keystrokes, mouse clicks, on-screen events) to detect
repetitive actions that are candidates for automation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The path described above is not accessible to many bureaucrats for
multiple reasons. The barriers to automating bureaucracy depend on
having relevant skills, IT resources, and predictable workflows that
justify the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment">return on
investment</a>. Compounding these hurdles, the skill of identifying
opportunities for automation depends on your practical skills (what are
you capable of) and your experience.</p>
<p>Where you are in the hierarchy of your bureaucratic organization
effects your options. Automating bureaucracy from the bottom-up can be
augmented and supported by management. At the organizational level,
there are system-level changes like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hire people who desire automation and the skills to enact
automation.</p></li>
<li><p>Use tracking bits in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF">PDFs</a> and webpages to
collect data on how systems are used. This decreases the burden on
process participants to report metrics and can be less biased since it
does not rely on self-reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a metrics aggregation service. The ability to store
metrics from multiple teams enables a holistic perspective on the
organization and can help identify chokepoints. Without the ability to
view the entire organization, premature optimization is likely.</p></li>
<li><p>Align incentives (e.g., pay, promotion) with implementation of
automation.</p></li>
<li><p>Transition from paper to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF">PDF</a> to a website to an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> (application
programming interface).<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Members of bureaucratic teams should be trained to develop
software, share code, use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a>s, create APIs, and
maintain APIs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Automation can reduce labor costs, but designing, implementing,
maintaining, and updating automation requires significant investment,
change of culture, and new skills for the workforce.</p>
<p>When automating bureaucratic processes, exceptions disrupt the
expected workflow of tasks that comprise the process. Handling
exceptions is a tricky subjective topic because exceptions are sometimes
critical to allow for and can be abused. Abuse of exceptions to a
process can originate from the subjects of a process or from the
bureaucrats administering the process.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.5" id="exceptions-to-a-process"><span
class="header-section-number">8.5</span> Exceptions to a Process<span
id="sec:exceptions-to-process"
label="sec:exceptions-to-process"></span></h2>
<p>Process designers are usually motivated to address a specific issue
associated with access to shared resources. When bureaucrats execute a
process to support a policy, there may be cases that violate the
designer's assumptions. Now the person with the exceptional case and the
bureaucrat carrying out the policy have extra work to deal with the
broken process. This is a source of <a
href="#sec:bureaucratic-debt">bureaucratic debt</a>.</p>
<p>When the routine process is inadequate, there are routes for
exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Change the process to address the exceptional case. This takes
extra time and work for the subject and the bureaucrat.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore the process. Use relationships instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore the task. If the result wasn't crucial to your efforts and
the work is too burdensome compared to alternatives, terminate the
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Seek an exception to the process. The exception can be recurring
or one-time. The justification for the exception can be based on social
capital of participants (title, reputation) or be a data-driven argument
or some mixture of both.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The designer of a process may not be able to anticipate future
circumstances, but expecting the capacity to be responsive to change is
reasonable. The process designer should use sunset provisions and escape
hatches. A sunset provision can be time-based (this policy expires after
3 years) or based on a threshold (this policy should be evaluated for
renewal after 1000 cases). An escape hatch specifies the conditions
under which the participants are excepted from the policy. A good escape
hatch for a policy provides directions about what follow-on actions
should be taken.</p>
<p>Another reason processes may be inadequate is due to urgency. A
result that is needed quickly may not fit the timeline of sequential
tasks for a process.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="time-sensitivity-exceptions">Time Sensitivity
Exceptions</h3>
<p>Exceptions to a process may be required when a result is need
quickly. In the medical setting there are categories of urgency; a task
may be routine, priority, urgent, stat. Each of those categories is
associated with a time bound, though the specific duration varies by
medical domain and by location.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Common failure modes for processes include abuse of prioritization
(everything is important) or abuse of urgency (everything is needed
quickly). Either of these abuses need to be corrected to have a healthy
bureaucracy, but typically the cost of labeling an effort as "priority"
or "urgent" is low.</p>
<p>To limit abuse of processes, interaction between the bureaucrats
tasked with work and the people characterizing relative value is needed.
This interaction is a negotiation of what work gets done when and in
what order. Labeling every task as "urgent" is a failure to communicate
the relative value of a set of tasks.</p>
<p>Process friction can arise from the separation of roles needed to
support a process. Those separate roles can happen within a team of
bureaucrats, or the process can span distinct teams. The difficulty
imposed across teams within an organization is moderated by the
existence of a common arbiter in the chain of command. Troubleshooting
processes is even more complicated when processes span
organizations.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.6" id="processes-involving-two-organizations"><span
class="header-section-number">8.6</span> Processes Involving Two

<p>When two independently-managed processes interact across
organizational boundaries there can be friction. Process friction,
especially between two organizations that lack shared coordination,
results in either <a href="#sec:exceptions-to-process">exceptions to the
process</a>, lying, or a <a href="#sec:change-a-process">change in

<p>The following stories illustrate process friction between teams
within an organization and process friction between organizations. The
teams within an organization have shared objectives set by the
organization, whereas separate organizations lack incentives to
coordinate.</p>
<p>Two teams operating within an organization, with a shared intent and
working relationship, may be stuck with the process they have even when
the friction is clear. When organizations lack a common objective, the
friction can be even more significant.</p>

<p>This story is about receipts from one process being submitted for

accountability and justification burden to the accepting bureaucrat.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>I have dental insurance. I visited the dentist December 2 and one of
the procedures during a routine cleaning was "bitewing x-rays." This
procedure is covered by my insurance, so I was surprised when I received
a bill for it from my dentist a few weeks after my visit.</p>
<p>I called my dentist and they explained that the dental insurance had
declined to pay for the procedure. I called the insurance company
January 3 and they confirmed that the procedure was covered by my
policy. Every time I call the insurance provider I had to provide my
social security number, date of birth, and zip code twice -- once to the
automated system, a second time to the person I talk with. The insurance
company apparently had made a mistake and said they would cover the cost
of the procedure. I followed up with my dentist and explained the
situation.</p>
<p>I called the dentist to see if they had received payment yet. They
had not, so I called the dental insurance provider again February 6 and
8. February 8 the insurance company said they would process the payment
within 7-10 business days. I called again February 20 and the claim
hadn't been started within the insurance company. I spoke to the
supervisor and she said she would personally visit the claims office
within the insurance company.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the dentist, they are seeking money for the
service they provided me.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the insurance company, delaying payment on a
claim makes good financial sense -- the policy holder is likely to just
pay the balance to avoid going to court with the dentist.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the question is whether chasing this issue makes
financial sense. I think of my hourly rate as $40, so after an hour the
charge of $38 would have been better to pay out of pocket. Effectively
I'm devaluing my time. The emotional stress and thought-cycles spent are
also relevant, though harder to quantify.</p>
<p>Streamlining bureaucratic processes does not occur automatically.
There needs to be both incentive to change and authority to make the
change.</p>
</div>
<p>In the above story the dental office wanted to be paid for services
provided. The insurance company wanted to minimize the number of
payments made. And I wanted to minimize my costs. While none of those
are conflicting, each organization has separate objectives.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="deploying-bureaucrats-to-different-teams-or-organizations">Deploying
Bureaucrats to Different Teams or Organizations<span
id="sec:prisoner-exchange" label="sec:prisoner-exchange"></span></h3>
<p>One method of addressing friction between teams or organizations is
to deploy a person across boundaries. This may not result in a specific
change, but it can help members of both the originating team and
receiving team better understand their counterpart. For the rest of this
section I'll use "team&nbsp;A" as the origin and "team&nbsp;B" as the receiver,
though the concept applies to exchange of organization members. The name
of the bureaucrat in this example is Mark. This example covers an
informal deployment in which Mark remains employed with team&nbsp;A. While
Mark is with team&nbsp;B he provides the management of team&nbsp;A with a weekly
activity report.</p>
<p>The easiest question regarding Mark's deployment to team&nbsp;B is "how
long?" That depends on the purpose of the exercise and the complexity of
the work Mark will be doing with team&nbsp;B, as well as how long team&nbsp;A can
operate without Mark's contributions. What is a successful outcome for
Mark? For team&nbsp;A? For team&nbsp;B? For the organization? How long will
integration of Mark onto team&nbsp;B take? Does Mark need time on team&nbsp;A to
delegate current work?</p>
<p>A deployment harms the productivity of originating team&nbsp;A by loss of
staff. The deployment also harms Mark's productivity for his work with
team&nbsp;A. The deployment harms the receiving team&nbsp;B since they have to
train or integrate Mark.</p>
<p>Incentives for this investment include cross-training for Mark,
better process empathy for both teams, and temporary (exceptional)
support. What is team&nbsp;B expecting from Mark? How will team&nbsp;A benefit?
What is Mark expecting to gain from the deployment? Or is this a
sacrifice on Mark's part?</p>
<p>Cross-training Mark can improve productivity of Mark and the teams.
team&nbsp;B gets to hear an outsider's perspective from Mark, and Mark
returns to team&nbsp;A with a broader perspective of the organization. A
deployment can build relationships among the teams. Both teams are
better able to address process friction or exceptional interactions.</p>
<p>Potential engagement modes for Mark: consultant (providing knowledge
to team&nbsp;B), integree (increasing the capacity of team&nbsp;B), or shadowing
(learning from team&nbsp;B). Shadowing can be of an individual on team&nbsp;B, or
Mark can shadow team&nbsp;B by attending meetings.</p>
<p>Mark could be deployed full time for the entire duration, split his
him between teams, or build-up and back-down over the course of the
deployment.</p>
<p>Are there criteria for early termination of the deployment? Are there
criteria for extending Mark's deployment?</p>
<p>If this sounds useful to your team there are a few considerations.
Are you on the originating team A or the receiving team B? Who gets
deployed? How is Mark picked? Was the opportunity advertised? If you're
receiving Mark, what are your acceptance criteria? How many concurrent
deployments can your team support?</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="service-level-agreements">Service-Level
Agreements<span id="sec:sla" label="sec:sla"></span></h3>
<p>When two teams or two organizations need to interact on a recurring
basis, a formalized approach is to create a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">Service-Level
Agreement</a>. While a Service-Level Agreement (SLA) is constructive for
outlining what each party expects from the other, within a bureaucracy
an SLA is typically not a legally binding contractual agreement. Instead
of a judge resolving disputes, an SLA within a bureaucracy may be
adjudicated by a supervisor common to the two teams.</p>
<p>A Service-Level Agreement within a bureaucracy is dependent on the
good will and honor of the signatories. Since an SLA is a formalization
of a relationship, it is subject to revision when there is turn-over of
signatories in the teams.</p>
<p>An Service-Level Agreement should include providing historical and
live data to stakeholders so violations can be measured. Measurements
are needed because enforcement of the SLA is by the signatories.
Observability is key to accountability.</p>
<p>A supervisor common to the parties may be invoked when an SLA is not
met, or if there is a dispute over the interpretation of an SLA. Usually
the threat of invoking oversight is enough to coerce change in
negotiations. When the common supervisor gets involved there are not
many options available for sanctions. The supervisor could withhold
bonuses or promotions, or assign a new team lead, or re-negotiate the
SLA.</p>
<p>Because creation of SLAs are burdensome to all parties involved,
monitoring to enable enforcement incurs work, and punishment is limited,
most cooperation between teams and between organizations is informal and
ad hoc. Relying on personal relationships is easier than formal
agreements. Reputations, both for individual bureaucrats and for teams
and organizations, are then formed on the basis of performance and
reliability.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="fixes-are-difficult">Fixes are Difficult</h3>
<p>Imposing checks on a process as a way to reduce mistakes creates more
bureaucracy. The extra work can be in the form of redundant data

coordination of diverse activities in a bureaucracy requires that

class="header-section-number">8.8</span> Design of Processes<span
id="sec:design-of-processes"
label="sec:design-of-processes"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is the use of distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making for policies concerning access to shared resources. A
set of processes is used by bureaucrats to leverage specialization and
improve throughput.</p>
<p>Because bureaucrats are typically not formally trained in designing
processes, ad hoc ideas reactive to the immediate situation and local
constraints are used. A thoughtful process designer attempts to account
for exceptions .</p>
<p>The most effective process is a minimal process. When designing a
process, look for ways to minimize the work for people involved.
Minimizing work (both physical and mental) for the people involved means
less sensitivity to entropy in a bureaucracy. Minimizing work requires
significant situational awareness on the part of the designer. To
minimize effect on existing bureaucracy, it's vital to minimize the
requirements to achieve success.</p>
<p>Another question to ask when designing a bureaucratic process is
whether a process is actually needed. Can the goal be accomplished
relying on ad hoc responses and leverage relationships among
bureaucrats? There is a Goldilocks situation for number of processes in
an organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Too few processes (all social relationships). New participants,
lacking necessary relationships, find the team or organization
chaotic.</p></li>
<li><p>Just the right amount -- a balance process and social, and when to
use which is known. Each participant has a different view about what the
right balance is based on what relationships are accessible to them, and
how burdensome they find a process.</p></li>
<li><p>Too much process (not enough leveraging of social relationships).
When this happens, bureaucrats can end up resorting to use of social
relationships to circumvent burdensome processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This optimization is like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer curve</a> in
economics.</p>
<p>Minimal processes and subtle change may not be available. The
following sections describe why static process designs are the norm, the
role of bureaucratic debt, and how to design for turnover of staff.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="static-and-dynamic-process">Static and
Dynamic Process<span id="sec:static-dynamic-processes"
label="sec:static-dynamic-processes"></span></h3>
<p>Change within an <span data-acronym-label="organization"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">organization</span> is to be expected
since the external environment the organization exists in is not static.
Sources of external change include improving technology, changes to the
<span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span>, or shifting
expectations of subjects of the bureaucracy. Change is also driven
internally to the organization by <a href="#sec:turnover">staff
turnover</a>. Since change is expected, why are static processes that
are not robust to change created in the first place? Because static
processes are easier to design and appear initially to require less
maintenance.</p>
<p>Creating robust processes that are dynamic takes more effort to
create. First, the process must be documented so that it can be
analyzed. What is expected to happen? Who are the stakeholders? These
conditions is likely to change, making the process fragile. Second,
document assumptions used in the process. If the assumptions are
invalidated, then the process is broken and needs to be discarded or at
least revised.</p>
<p>A challenge is that even when the process is documented and
assumptions enumerated, there may not be an incentive to check to see if
revision is necessary. Measurements (which are costly and disruptive)
need to be periodically taken to see if the assumptions are still
applicable. To force periodic validation of assumptions, one approach is
to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision">sunset
provisions</a>.</p>
<p>A more quantitative approach is to tie a process to a cost-benefit
model. Implementing a process provides a benefit and comes at some cost.
If the assumptions of the process can be tied to a cost-benefit model,
then we can determine whether the process is worth implementing.
Periodic measurements are needed to update the cost-benefit model and
determine whether the process is effective.</p>

<li><p>If the assumptions are broken, revise the process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A robust process is just a fragile process with a feedback loop
informed by ongoing measurements. Robust processes require extra work by
bureaucrats compared to static processes. A static process shifts the
burden to subjects -- bureaucrats have externalized the burden. In
practice, ignoring exceptions and reacting to problems is common because
then there's less work for the bureaucrats enacting the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The above description of robust dynamic processes and fragile static
processes characterizes workflows in isolation from the history of a
team or organization. Typically processes are evolved from previous
processes. That evolution induces another source of bureaucratic
friction.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="decisions-and-processes-create-bureaucratic-debt">Decisions and
Processes Create Bureaucratic Debt<span id="sec:bureaucratic-debt"
label="sec:bureaucratic-debt"></span></h3>
<p>Suppose a <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> is enacted and later
found to be ineffective. Some work is needed to revise the process and
hopefully improve effectiveness (or an <a
href="#sec:exceptions-to-process">exception</a> is needed). Bureaucratic
debt is the work needed to change a process.<a href="#fn67"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>
Bureaucratic debt is caused by choosing an easy solution now (with
limited information or insufficient resources) instead of using an
approach that would take longer to design and enact but be more
robust.</p>
<p>Decisions made by <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">bureaucrats</span> occur in a resource
constrained environment. Getting information (measurement) and analysis
are costly in terms of money, time, skill, and labor. Each decision made
results in options that are not explored. These missed opportunities are
associated with short-term versus long-term trade-offs of costs.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity
costs</a> (options the organization doesn't take) alters which future
decisions become available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The purpose of defining bureaucratic debt as a concept is to capture the
work resulting from decisions that would otherwise be unaccounted for.
Once the concept of bureaucratic debt is understood it can be
tracked.</p>
<p>To document bureaucratic debt, you need to record aspects of
decisions as they are made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the decision to be made?</p></li>
<li><p>When the decision was identified?</p></li>
<li><p>When the decision was made?</p></li>
<li><p>Who made the decision?</p></li>
<li><p>What options were identified?</p></li>
<li><p>Which option was chosen?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was that option was chosen over the other options?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of documenting decisions is to enable both aversion to
bad decisions and attraction to good decisions. That may sound strange,
but the default of decision-makers is to apply the same behavior in
future decisions. Without documenting decisions, there is no
transparency, accountability, historical measure of progress, or ability
to track dependencies.</p>
<p>Creating a record of decisions is necessary but not sufficient. The
documentation of decisions needs to be disseminated to stakeholders to
enable accountability. This should occur as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>Every bureaucrat exercises policies that apply to subjects, even if
the subjects are other bureaucrats. What I'm describing above is beyond
merely documenting what the processes and policies are for subjects.
Documenting bureaucratic debt is for use internal to the team or
organization.</p>
<p>The scale of decision impact determines the level of documentation.
"Do I choose pencil or pen?" incurs negligible bureaucratic debt;
therefore the documentation needed is also negligible. Projecting impact
of decisions is a subjective prediction.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="design-processes-for-turnover-of-staff">Design Processes for
Turnover of Staff<span id="sec:turnover"
label="sec:turnover"></span></h3>
<p>When designing a <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span>, there are a few goals
to optimize for: time-to-first-result, average latency, initial
financial cost, total financial cost, flexibility to input conditions,
throughput, scalability. In a theoretical sense all these factors should
inform decision-making. An often neglected aspect which is harder to
predict and harder to measure is the importance of employee turnover. On
a long time scale, turnover of <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">bureaucrats</span> is a significant
source of risk for any team or project.</p>
<p>Processes are implemented differently than intended because the
people implementing them are not the same people who came up with and
designed them.</p>
<p>Designing processes relies on roles: participants are treated as
interchangeable with other people who have similar skills. As a
bureaucrat coming up with a novel process, accounting for differences in
enthusiasm or communication among participants is difficult. Designing
processes that are robust to turnover does not mean ignoring the unique
talents of participants. Emphasize documentation (how and why) and
training of new participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Making processes resilient to change requires bureaucrats be educated
beyond the requirements of the immediate task. That education occurs
during onboarding of the bureaucrat, while carrying out the process, and
as bureaucrats exit participation in the process.</p>
<p>Onboarding new bureaucrats involves technical training, explanation
of norms, learning the processes, and creating a professional network of
coworkers. During this onboarding the new bureaucrat should be
documenting their observations. Postponing the creation of documentation
until the new person has experience results in a skewed and incomplete
capture of the challenges.</p>
<p>Trained and experienced bureaucrats executing a process are
responsible for coordinating with other bureaucrats. Bureaucrats should
be cross-trained in other roles to gain familiarity with other parts of
a process.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats exiting the team or organization or changing roles have a
responsibility to document their knowledge for team members. An exit
interview can inform how the team improves.</p>
<p>In each phase documentation is the mechanism for spreading knowledge.
Documenting the why (in addition to the how) is critical for the reader.
Access to documentation should be measured to determine whether there is
value to the investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The opportunity for you to create novel processes is likely to be rare
if you are a bureaucrat in an old organization or team. A more frequent
activity is updating and revising existing processes. The next section
covers topics specific to changeing a process.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.9" id="change-existing-processes"><span
class="header-section-number">8.9</span> Change Existing Processes<span
id="sec:change-a-process" label="sec:change-a-process"></span></h2>
<p>New processes can arise organically or be issued as top-down edicts.
Processes evolve to fit the constraints of available resources and
skills of bureaucrats and subjects. These causes of consistent flux mean
updates to policies and process are ongoing. Whether you are a
bureaucrat administering a process, a subject burdened by a process, or
a bureaucrat responsible for revising processes, you have input on
changes.</p>
<p>Processes change over time because the conditions change. When a
bureaucratic process is no longer providing value to the organization or
the participants, change is needed.</p>
<p>Changing complex processes is hard because individuals involved in
the process may depend on steps that are not visible to other
people.</p>
<p>Making change more complicated is the entanglement of inter-dependent
processes. Processes do not exist in isolation.<a href="#fn68"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>When change to processes is attempted, change is slow to happen
because of lag in feedback loops.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucratic-inertia">Bureaucratic
Inertia</h3>
<p>Creating an organization, recruiting staff, getting funding, getting
office space, setting up communication technologies, and creating
processes is a significant investment of time and money and people. That
same work applies when making changes to the size and scope of an
organization (making it larger or smaller). Because this work and
attention take time, there is a lag associated with changes to an
organization that better reflect the scope of tasks and the number of
tasks. The lag of changes as they ripple through an organization
characterize <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic_inertia">bureaucratic
inertia</a>.</p>
<p>At a more personal scale, the causes of bureaucratic inertia are
attributable to changes to processes or creating new processes. A
process displaces the need for bureaucrats to think, so new processes
force bureaucrats to think about their roles or develop new skills.</p>
<p>Another source of bureaucratic inertia is the over-subscription of
tasks to the amount of attention available and resources available. In
the situation where there isn't enough resources or attention, then the
response to some tasks is necessarily delayed or left unaddressed.
Delayed tasks block the workflows that depend on those outcomes.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="why-change-a-process">Why Change a
Process</h3>
<p>Why changes to a process occur in a bureaucratic organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To make an improvement to an existing processes that are working
as desired (i.e., a more clever solution).</p></li>
<li><p>Improving an existing process by undoing mistakes previously
made.</p></li>
<li><p>Inventing a new process where there previously was not
one.</p></li>
<li><p>If utility and improvement are difficult to quantify bureaucratic
activities, then bureaucrats may be promoted based on change instead of
whether value was delivered.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you recognize that processes are evolutionary, then the right
response is to allow and look for iterative change (fail fast) rather
than trying to create static processes.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-change-a-process">How to Change a
Process</h3>
<p>Change to a process can come from the top of the organization
hierarchy or from the bottom.</p>
<p>When change is driven from the top-down,<br />
<em>Benefit</em>: Unified vision enables global optimization.<br />
<em>Inefficiency</em>: Can't see all the details from the top, so
solutions may not fit well.<br />
<em>Resolution</em>: Better reporting up the chain.</p>
<p>When change is driven from the bottom up,<br />
<em>Benefit</em>: Each component in the hierarchy has local control,
sees local aspects, and creates solutions for the local problem.<br />
<em>Inefficiency</em>: Local optimization<a href="#fn69"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>
across multiple components in a workflow can yield suboptimal
outcomes.<br />
<em>Resolution</em>: Each local component acts with same objective</p>
<p>Regardless of where you are in the hierarchy there generally
applicable tips for changing a process. The first is to segment the
stakeholders, and the second is to find critical <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">OODA loops</a>, and the
third is to alter how you notify stakeholders.</p>
<p>Even if you use the tactics describe here, you are likely to
encounter resistance. Transitioning from legacy processes to new
processes impacts the bureaucrats involved. Changes have to overcome
legacy investments. People can feel threatened by the change of role or
skills.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="tactic-segment-stakeholders">Tactic: Segment
Stakeholders</h3>
<p>The people a process is inflicted upon are not all the same. Some
example categories of bureaucratic subjects are normal users, power
users, and malicious users. In a similar manner, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation">segmenting</a>
the stakeholders for a potential change can help you distinguish
different levels of support or resistance.</p>
<p>The concept of a <span data-acronym-label="stakeholder"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">stakeholder</span> is broader than
just the people in various roles carrying out the tasks associated with
a bureaucratic process. To be more effective in enacting change,
identify people in the following groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People interested in active collaboration. They may not share
your zeal, but finding shared activities is helpful for
participation.</p></li>
<li><p>People who passively support the activity but do not provide
resources. May provide feedback or enlarge the coalition.</p></li>
<li><p>People who don't care and are not engaged.</p></li>
<li><p>People who disagree with you. Seek these contrarians out to
refine the idea or scope. Negotiate! Be open to evolving the concept to
address or at least acknowledge their concerns.</p></li>
<li><p>People who are actively working against you. Try to understand
their motives. Not through speculation, but by direct discussion.
Written communication is inadequate; face-to-face is best since you are
more likely to be treated like a human rather than an idea or
concept.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Which segment a person is part of changes as your scope and timeline
shifts. Their activities and priorities may cause their position to
evolve.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="tactic-find-critical-ooda-loops">Tactic: Find
Critical OODA loops</h3>
<p>Influence is not distributed equitably among members of a team or
organization. For that reason, surveys may be misleading. If you want to
change a process, focusing your attention on crucial influencers is more
effective than trying spending the same amount of time learning from
every bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The colloquial use of "influencer" doesn't reflect the bureaucratic
sense of shaping direction for an organization or team. Because the term
"leader" is over-used, a more precise label is "maven." Some mavens are
highly visible, while other mavens work behind the scenes. Mavens may or
may not be highly-placed in the hierarchy of the organization, and they
may not have fancy titles.</p>
<p>The approach to changing a process being described here takes two
steps: figure out who matters in an organization or team, then change
how those influencers think and act.</p>
<p>The first step is to use a social implementation of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> to find the
relevant mavens for a given topic or process. You start your search with
random bureaucrats (sampled from across the organization). In a
one-on-one interaction, ask the person who they would recommend talking
to. "Who else would you recommend talking to about this topic?" is the
last question in the first conversation. To start this search process,
start with your first-order social connections. Cover both low-level
bureaucrats and higher in the chain of command.</p>
<p>Once you've started your search for mavens, leverage the trust
already in the social network by starting conversations with "When I
spoke with Bob he recommended I talk to you about <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>name of topic<span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>."</p>
<p>Once you've identified mavens for the topic or process you want to
change, the next step is to change how the mavens think.</p>
<p>A model for human decision-making is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">OODA loop</a>. If you
want to change a process, change the people; if you want to change
people, change their OODA loop. That means changing the data the person
is aware of (what they observe), change the external incentives (how
they orient), and teach them new decision frameworks (e.g., cost-benefit
models).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="tactic-approval-forgiveness-opposition">Tactic: Approval,
Forgiveness, Opposition<span id="sec:approval-forgiveness-opposition"
label="sec:approval-forgiveness-opposition"></span></h3>
<p>Bureaucracy involves distributed decision-making. A common
bureaucratic task is seeking consensus regarding action or spending
resources. There are distinct options about how to get that
consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seek approval before taking action. This approach incurs both
providing justification and waiting.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask forgiveness after taking action. Often viewed as being in
contrast to seeking approval. Less delay, and usually works if things go
well or if no one notices.</p></li>
<li><p>Notification of Intent with deadline for response. The window for
response should be sufficient to actually allow feedback. If no response
is provided default is for action to be taken.</p></li>
<li><p>Solicit opposition before taking action.<a href="#fn70"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>
This is a different framing from approval or forgiveness. It decreases
the risk the approver has to take on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to proceed depends on the personalities of the people
involved in building consensus and their relationships.</p>
<p>Most organizations default to an approval-based processes. Each new
idea needs to be signed off as approved by a sequential list of <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">bureaucrats</span>. The sequential (not
concurrent) process may be known in advance, or it may be ad hoc if the
request is novel.</p>
<p>Relying on approval is harmful to innovation because sign-off by each
bureaucrat is interpreted as "I am 100% in agreement with this." Each
stakeholder has to bless innovation and tie their reputation to the
outcome.</p>
<p>Soliciting opposition and a response of "I won't stop this" is a more
useful paradigm. With the consensus process language changed to "I won't
stop this," then the bureaucrat reviewing the idea can avoid taking
responsibility for the idea and therefore is not tying their reputation
to the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The section above described tactics for changes to processes driven by
changes of resources or staffing but assuming the underlying policy had
remained the same. The next section describes the case where changes to
a policy require that processes be revised.</p>

You could operate within a <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> and entirely focus
on just doing the job you were hired for and ignore administrative
distractions. Or you can be more effective in your job by understanding
the role of engaging with other people -- peer bureaucrats, supervisors,
and subjects of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Learning bureaucracy as a skill doesn't mean you can ignore
personalities of individuals. Bureaucracy as a skill separate from and
in addition to being a good person, being an effective member of a team,
being a good project manager, being a good product owner, skillful
writing, excellent verbal communication skills, applying technical
skills, etc. The distinction from those aspects is that as a bureaucrat
you understand the complications and constraints of your environment and
then can more effectively operate within those conditions.</p>
<p>If you are new to being a <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span>, then this book
armed you with understanding your environment. On your first day of
employment you are capable of framing new information constructively. If
you are an experienced bureaucrat, it is not too late to improve. Even
on your last day of employment you can learn and be more effective.</p>
<p>In this book I described bureaucracy and provided options for action.
If you are able to apply these generalized perspectives to your specific
situation, you are applying the paradigm developed throughout this book.
Concepts like learning the history of your situation, identifying and
engaging <span data-acronym-label="stakeholder"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">stakeholders</span> to learn their
perspective. Brainstorming the incentives of the individuals involved,
and listing what levers they have for action. What are the <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a>? Are there feedback loops?</p>
<p>The narrow scope of your role (which hopefully leverages your
education or training) does not capture all relevant aspects of your
job. Based on the definition of <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span>, the critical
aspects of success are having knowledge, sharing your knowledge,
leveraging the knowledge of others, effective communication, working
well with other people, understanding the role of both processes and
social influence, and how those interplay.</p>
<p>The attitude of the effective bureaucrat is that of realistic
optimism. A realistic optimist will occasionally be wrong but makes
progress, whereas a pessimist will be right (because the prediction is
self-fulfilling) but not make progress.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.1" id="interviewing-a-candidate"><span
class="header-section-number">11.1</span> Interviewing a Candidate</h2>
<p>Interviewing candidates for a bureaucratic position should involve
evaluation of skills specific to bureaucracy. For example, ask questions
that all the candidate to demonstrate that they can communicate to
facilitate coordination, work with experts from other domains, learn
from self-reflection, have an ability to professionally disagree, and
practice negotiation.</p>
<p>A specific phrasing I use below is "Tell me about a time you..."
rather than asking the candidate to speculate about a hypothetical
scenario ("What would you do if..."). The retrospective story is more
concrete and demonstrates an ability to reflect on their behaviors.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tell me about a time you had competing priorities.<br />
<em>What to evaluate for</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did the interviewee coordinate a response with other people?

<li><p>Did the interviewee clarify a misconception?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How does this position fit into your career goal?<br />
<em>What to evaluate for</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can the organization provide the candidate what they are
seeking?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In previous jobs, how often did you check in with your supervisor
(formally or informally)?<br />
<em>What to evaluate for</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the candidate communicate with their supervisor?</p></li>
<li><p>Who starts the discussion?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In previous jobs, how often did you check in with your coworkers
(formally or informally)?<br />
<em>What to evaluate for</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the candidate communicate with their peers?</p></li>

<li><p>How do you engage with coworkers who know something work-related
that you want to learn?</p></li>

ill-defined, or constantly shifting.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe how you responded to a mistake you made at
work.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell me about a time the organization you were in changed and how
you navigated that.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell me about a time when you, in your role as an expert,
collaborated with people who didn't share your expertise. How does that
compare with interacting with fellow experts?</p></li>
<li><p>When you have learned a new topic in the past, what strategies
did you use to balance understanding the theory and doing the
practice?</p></li>
<li><p>How have you assessed your progress when you were learning a new

<h2 data-number="11.2" id="moving-to-a-new-team"><span
class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Moving to a New Team</h2>
<p>Prior to leaving the team you're on, reflect on your current
role:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are my current care-abouts?</p></li>
<li><p>What would I miss from my current role? Are there projects,
tasks, responsibilities, or people that I will miss? If yes, can I
change my current role to have more of what I like?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can negotiate with your management and coworkers to address your
needs. Sometimes other people are not aware of what you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Once you are interviewing for a position you should be considering the
interactions as a chance to learn more about the work and the people.
When interviewing for a new position, ask the following questions:<a

<li><p>Is the team growing or is the focus shifting?<br />
(Teams hire to replace or grow. If replacing, why did the person leave?
