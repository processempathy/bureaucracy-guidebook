<p>Thank you to my coworkers. Our interactions taught me how to be a
better bureaucrat.</p>
<p><span id="contents"></span></p>
<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>When you are in a situation you haven’t been in before, having a
guide can decrease anxiety by making the unfamiliar less intimidating. A
guide labels patterns and provides context for your observations.
Recognizing a familiar challenge can be preferable to the uncertainty of
facing a scenario that is novel. A situation that is unfamiliar means
not knowing how to start and not knowing what potential paths to success
are. In contrast, a challenge that is understood from the start can feel
less burdensome. Even a challenge that is understood requires creativity
and effort.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is a consistent and pervasive challenge in modern
society. You probably have direct experience with bureaucracy, and you
may be familiar with complaints about bureaucracy. You probably don’t
consider yourself a bureaucrat, and probably are not an expert on
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Negative impressions of bureaucracy are common. The word evokes
reactions of disgust, primarily driven by how individuals have
experienced bureaucracy. The results of bureaucracy can appear idiotic.
Bureaucracy is even regarded as dangerous to society<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. I
have bad news for you if you have a negative impression of bureaucracy:
bureaucracy is vital to society. Organizations have an insatiable need
for members to perform a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can learn to skillfully navigate
bureaucracy. The consequence is that a skilled bureaucrat is more
effective. That improvement enhances the organization you are part of.
Modern society is an interwoven fabric of organizations, with
bureaucracy being the crucial material. Rather than ponder
societal-scale concerns, the focus of this book is on the complex and
typical experience of a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The framing of how you think about bureaucracy shapes what action you
think is relevant for changing your environment. If your assumptions are
wrong about how the system of bureaucracy works, then you will be trying
to convert the system to meet your incorrect expectations and your
actions are likely to be wasted effort tackling irrelevant aspects. An
accurate model of bureaucracy allows you to be more effective and your
changes to the system are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Having a precise definition of bureaucracy enables a clearer
discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is the set of
subjective decisions made by individual participants in an organization.
The decisions originate from the management of shared resources. The
resources can be either tangible or in the form of expertise.
Bureaucracy relies on distributed knowledge and distributed decision
making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concepts and techniques in this book are derived from this
definition. For more exploration of this definition, see the section “<a
href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">What is Bureaucracy?</a>” on page .</p>
<p>As an example of how the above definition is distinct from
conventional definitions<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I view government as an instance of
where bureaucracy occurs. Bureaucracy is not limited to government. I
use the term “organization” to encompass governments, corporations,
non-profits, or any collection of people working together. As a
consequence, a vast majority of people are bureaucrats.</p>
<p>The negative connotation of bureaucracy may lead you to reject the
label of bureaucrat. Your recognition of your status as a bureaucrat
matters even if you intentionally reject the label or simply do not
recognize that you are a bureaucrat. How you behave and what you think
your responsibilities are depend on how you label yourself. If you don’t
think of yourself as a bureaucrat, then you won’t be able to distinguish
what is your own fault, what is the fault of your coworkers, what is the
fault of management, and what is intrinsic to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Reasoning about bureaucracy is an accessible topic for every reader
because we each have personal experience. A commonly held view is that
the systems of bureaucracy that we work within are broken: participants
are harmed and there is inequality. The counterargument is that the
bureaucratic behavior observed is how the system was designed to work.
There is a third argument: bureaucratic systems work in a degraded mode
– being less efficient than what is possible. In this book I set aside
the macro-scale questions of bureaucracy like the three arguments above
and focus on the human-scale interactions that give rise to
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Even people who are smart (e.g., they know history, they have
memorized capital cities, they can do math) can struggle when faced with
complex large-scale distributed systems comprised of humans. Thinking
about complex large-scale systems is not part of the conventional
education curriculum. This book will help you learn about bureaucracy,
increase your ability to identify patterns, and apply relevant
techniques.</p>
<p>The difficulties of bureaucracy are central to large societies that
depend on complex interactions of many people. The challenge of
bureaucracy is widespread across a variety of governments and companies
in different societies. And bureaucracy is durable – it has existed for
thousands of years. Because bureaucracy is pervasive, tackling the topic
of bureaucracy is exciting and crucial. The excitement comes from the
opportunities available for the many potential improvements. Being an
effective bureaucrat is important because bureaucracy can be a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication">force
multiplier</a> beyond what one person could accomplish on their own.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are curious about the complex world we
live in, or if you are thinking about how to productively contribute to
society, or if you want impactful employment, or if your job is not what
you expected. If you’re wondering why innovation is hard within a
bureaucratic organization, this book is intended to help you understand
the challenges. Understanding the challenges means you can design ideas
that are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Every person in society is a participant in bureaucracy. The purpose
of this book is to decrease the surprise of that experience and better
prepare you emotionally and intellectually for the toil of being a
bureaucrat. With focused reflection and a good guide, you can improve
your skills as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The topic of bureaucracy spans academic disciplines - <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">psychology</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology">sociology</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_behavior">organizational
dynamics</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration">public
administration</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology">anthropology</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science">political
science</a>. Most bureaucrats have no formal training in any of these
domains. This book is not written from the academic perspective; it is
written by a practicing bureaucrat to serve as a guide to be read by
bureaucrats.</p>
<p>This book is not a defense of bureaucracy, nor is it intended to
disparage bureaucrats or the system of bureaucracy. Instead, the intent
of this book is to serve as a guide to bureaucracy-as-it-is. There are
no hacks presented for circumventing bureaucracy. Instead, this book
provides advice on being an effective member of a bureaucratic
organization.</p>
<p>This book does not focus on leadership, managing a team, being a team
member, planning, time management, project management, advancing your
career, promotions, or self-improvement. In the process of being a
better bureaucrat some lessons may apply in those domains.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is domain specific, nothing is tied to
engineering of products, and nothing is applicable solely in science
research or policy development. However, skills associated with being an
effective bureaucrat do translate into other domains.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t address personal stress caused by bureaucracy, how
to decrease stress, or how to balance the activities of work and
life-outside-work. However, understanding bureaucracy can enable a
positive sense of self based on how your efforts integrate with other
people’s tasks.</p>
<p>This book does not address work conditions, pay, benefits, or
retirement plans. If you are seeking a competitive advantage that might
result in improved outcomes, learning how to navigate bureaucracy
helps.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t focus on citizens, political policy makers,
oversight (e.g., Congress – state or federal), competing organizations,
contracts, the budget of an organization, fines and other regulatory
punishments resulting from bureaucracy, policy enforcement, specific
policies and regulations, formal arbitration or judicial resolution of
disputes. For observations on those topics, see Wilson’s
Bureaucracy <span class="citation" data-cites="1991_Wilson">(J. Q.
Wilson 1991)</span>.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t address discrimination or harassment. I neglect
differences of experience based on the race, gender, or socioeconomic
status. This book doesn’t address bad coworkers, abusive bosses,
psychological defects of individuals, or malicious intent. I assume no
traitors, spies, or <a
href="https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;did=750070">saboteurs</a><a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. I do not address <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">dark patterns</a>;
issues like lying, bribery <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021_Ang">(Ang 2021)</span>, and criminal behavior are not
discussed. All of those aspects happen whenever people interact; those
challenges are not specific to bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is not a
manifestation of incompetence, malicious actors, or mistakes. Sources of
friction in a well-run bureaucracy stem from perpetual challenges like
ambiguity, finite attention, and inadequate resources.</p>
<p>In this book I assume you are honest, and that other people are
honest. I assume bureaucrats strive for fairness, though the particular
definition of fairness may vary from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. Even with
all these simplifying assumptions the complexities of bureaucracy arise.
My guidance on how to be an effective bureaucrat is in the context of
benign bureaucracy.</p>
<p>As a result of reading this book, you will be better able to
recognize and navigate complex human interactions, both within your
career and outside of work. Perspectives offered in this book can
benefit you directly, whether by promotion of rank or title, increase in
pay, successful completion of a project, or through decreased stress
derived from improved understanding of how bureaucracy works. Being a
more effective bureaucrat can also positively impact the causes you care
about and the people you engage with.</p>
<p>Everyone is a bureaucrat because there are few alternatives to
bureaucracy for a society constrained by finite resources. Gaining
skills in navigating bureaucracy are helpful both for your own happiness
and the improved functioning of society. That may seem abstract and
lofty, but the situation is inescapable: you are a member of society and
you benefit from participating in society.</p>
<p>Hoping that modern technology will eliminate or reduce bureaucracy is
not a solution. Automation and computers merely obfuscate processes and
make negotiation more challenging. Even with faster decisions and fewer
humans, there is still reliance on humans to make decisions and design
processes.</p>
<p>Another approach to avoiding bureaucracy is to characterize
interactions with other people merely as personal relationships. That is
easier than considering bureaucracy as a complex system. This “just
relationships” view misses emergent phenomena and over-simplifies the
situation. As a result your effectiveness is decreased.</p>
<p>Focusing on the morals of organizations or bureaucrats<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> is
less compelling than studying bureaucracy because norms (i.e.,
expectations for individuals and organizations) shift over time, while
bureaucracy is persistent. In this book I focus on culturally invariant
aspects of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>This book is based on personal experience, reading published books
and papers, and anecdotes from other bureaucrats. Surveys are not the
foundation supporting the claims made. No <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment">double blind</a>
experiments were conducted. I have attempted to learn from my mistakes
by reflecting on my (in)actions and the consequences. This approach has
been an expensive education. My mistakes delayed progress and damaged
relationships. The motive driving this book is to provide
generalizations from my experiences which might benefit the reader.</p>
<p>Reading this book front-to-back is the default option, but not
essential. The dependencies of topics are not sequential – see Figure <a
href="#fig:core-concepts" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:core-concepts">1.1</a>.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Relation of the concepts related to
bureaucracy discussed in this book. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The approach in this book is to view bureaucracy from a few
perspectives. The first is a conceptual view focused on the <a

managing shared resources. The second view is structural (e.g.,
hierarchy, meetings). The <a href="#sec:fundamentals-of-b">essentials of
bureaucracy</a> (starting on page ) will be familiar to experienced
bureaucrats. The third view is based on experience of the practicing

<p>The motivating logic for this book is a sequence of claims:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A community has limited resources that are desired by members,
and the community mitigates that constraint by sharing
resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Managing access to a <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span> requires
making and enforcing policies that apply to community members.</p></li>
<li><p>When more than one person is responsible for making and enforcing
policies, then distributed knowledge and distributed decision making are
required.</p></li>
<li><p><span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is defined as
multiple people managing access to <span
data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether you’re a <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> or a subject of
bureaucracy, you can be more effective by applying <a
href="#sec:process-empathy">process empathy</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the concepts in this book,
using the what you’ve learned is a two step process. First, ask yourself
whether the conditions for bureaucracy are present. If they are, then
you can be more effective by applying process empathy.</p>
<p>The definition of bureaucracy is the basis for evaluating the
scenario you are in. Illustrations of bureaucracy provided throughout
this book demonstrate how you can grow your process empathy.</p>
<h2 id="process-empathy">Process Empathy<span id="sec:process-empathy"
label="sec:process-empathy"></span></h2>
<p>Empathy typically refers to understanding the emotions of another
person. To detect the emotional state of another person you rely on
facial expressions (smiles for happiness, frowns for frustration), body
language (arms crossed, turning away), speech (yelling in anger, singing
for joy), and actions (hitting something when angry). From these signals
you evaluate a person’s emotional state by recalling instances where you
felt similar emotions. Emotional empathy helps you understand the other
person.</p>
<p>A distinct form of empathy is the ability to understand the reasoning
another person uses. <a href="#sec:intellectual-empathy">Intellectual
empathy</a> is the concept of establishing a common understanding of an
issue (even if you don’t agree). Intellectual empathy can be applied in
both a one-on-one interaction and amongst a team of people. Intellectual
empathy is enacted by thinking about how another person would assess a
situation and how they might respond. Another technique is to imagine
what reasoning they would use when presented with a set of facts.</p>
<p>A third form of empathy is the focus of this book: the ability to
perceive why individuals working together behave in recurring patterns.
What incentives do people in each role have, what information does each
person have, and how does that manifest as actions by the team or
organization? Applying the paradigm of <span
data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span> helps you
answer questions like “Why is this taking so long?” and “Why is this
action so apparently inefficient?” even when no one participant is lazy
or inept. The answers come from recognizing <a
href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">unavoidable hazards</a> of bureaucracy.
As another example, the question of “Why are people under-trained for
their role?” is resolved by recognizing the consequence of constant <a
href="#sec:turnover">turnover</a>. Process empathy relies on
understanding bureaucracy so that you can distinguish which patterns are
specific to the people involved versus specific to this organization
versus generic to every organization.</p>
<p>Reasoning about a process is slightly different than process empathy.
Reasoning assumes a holistic external view (taken by Gall in <span
class="citation" data-cites="2002_Gall">(Gall 2002)</span>), whereas
process empathy is about the perspective of individual people operating
within their local context. Reasoning about teams and the aggregate
organization invariably leads to observations of illogical and absurd
outcomes, whereas a view based on process empathy reveals the causes of
apparent paradoxes.</p>
<p>Process empathy is comprised of thinking beyond professional
relationships with individuals and deeper than the abstraction of
team-as-entity and organization-as-entity. Because process empathy is
generic across bureaucracies, the benefit of this perspective is that
you can gain insight about people you don’t know doing work you don’t
understand. Each application will have nuances specific to the people
involved and the shared resource being managed, but process empathy
provides a useful framework for navigating bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Process empathy involves asking questions about your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What incentives do process participants face? Consider the (lack
of) <a href="#sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples">feedback loops</a>
(page ).</p></li>
<li><p>What unaligned goals do individual bureaucrats have that cause
friction?</p></li>
<li><p>To work towards their goals, what are the different paths
individual bureaucrats take? See <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a> on page .</p></li>
<li><p>How can you leverage the interplay between processes and
interpersonal professional relationships? See <a
href="#sec:reputation">reputation</a> management on page .</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than asking, “What benefits the team?” or “What supports the
organization?” the paradigm of process empathy focuses on people and
incentives. For example, to be effective you need to identify rules
(written and unwritten), determine who enforces what, consider the
detection mechanics for rule-breaking, and weigh the consequences of
subversion against the benefits of breaking rules.</p>
<p>The question of “When is process empathy applicable?" is answered by
“When bureaucracy is present." A clear understanding of bureaucracy is
necessary as the basis for building your process empathy.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-bureaucracy">What is Bureaucracy?<span
id="sec:define-bureaucracy" label="sec:define-bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>While you may know it when you see or experience bureaucracy<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, for this book definitions are
useful. Throughout the book I’ll refer back to these definitions as I
explain concepts needed to understand bureaucracy.</p>
<p><span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> involves the
creation and execution of <span data-acronym-label="policy"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">policys</span> for managing shared
resources. Creating and carrying out policies usually involves multiple
people, with each person having specialized roles. Motivated by
scalability (how many widgets), complexity (number of tasks per widget),
or latency (time per widget), members with distinct roles form a
hierarchical organization to facilitate coordination. The organization
has control over the disbursement of resources relevant to the society
the organization works within, or the organization administers a policy
within that society. Resources managed by the organization are either
tangible (e.g., water, air, land) or expertise.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is not limited to government. Non-profit organizations,
volunteer groups, commercial companies, and even small teams of people
can invoke bureaucratic tendencies. The existence of bureaucracy is
independent of an organization’s purpose, and independent of whether
money is involved. Carrying out someone else’s subjectively defined
policy will require you to make your own subjective decisions regarding
execution and enforcement.</p>
<p> <br />
Distinct roles can be identified within the description of bureaucracy.
A bureaucracy typically involves a policy creator, a policy enforcer,
and the person upon whom policy is inflicted. In the context of
government, the policy creator can be either a politician or a
bureaucrat. In the context of a family, the primary care taker usually
sets policies.</p>
<p>An organization comprised of bureaucrats is a <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span>. The main
character within a bureaucracy is the <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> – the person who is
a member of an organization and is responsible for subjective
implementation of policy for the organization. The person that a
bureaucrat’s decisions are inflicted on is a <span
data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>. Depending on context,
a subject may be a student (when the bureaucrat is a teacher) or a
subject may be a citizen if the bureaucrat is a police officer or
government official. Sometimes a bureaucrat’s decisions are inflicted on
other bureaucrats-as-subjects, such as when a Chief of Police creates
guidelines for police in their district, or when a senior diplomat sets
policy for embassy employees.</p>
<p>A <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> subjectively
interprets policies on behalf of their organization and has
discretionary enforcement. The bureaucrat’s purpose is to facilitate
coordination of stakeholders by applying specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>Let’s break that previous paragraph down piece-by-piece. First,
“subjective interpretation” means there is a person making a decision
about how to do something. The subjectivity arises from different
reasons one person might choose an option over a competing option. A
<span data-acronym-label="policy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">policy</span> is a set of actions in
a given circumstance. An <span data-acronym-label="organization"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">organization</span> is the collection
of people for who the policy is made. Discretionary enforcement means
the bureaucrat is choosing how to apply the policy in specific
circumstances. Facilitating coordination means bureaucracy is about
getting multiple people (or sometimes a person at different instances in
time) to work together. The stakeholders are people who care about the
application of the action in each circumstance. That’s still pretty
dense, so the rest of the book is spent expanding the nuances and
implications of this definition.</p>
<p> <br />
Bureaucracy is neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is not tied to
politics, nor is bureaucracy specific to an institution (e.g.,
corporations, governments, academia). The definition of bureaucracy used
in this book is independent of government. Bureaucracy is not defined to
be efficient; nor does it have to be inefficient. Bureaucracy is not
restricted to paperwork, record keeping, quantification, or gathering
metrics. Nothing in this definition involves paperwork or an office
building. Definitions that limit the concept of bureaucracy to specific
contexts result in a decreased ability to describe complex large-scale
organizations of humans.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is about delegation of control, communication, decision
making, coordination, and processes. A vital aspect of bureaucracy is
that everything is made up, specifically by humans.</p>

style="width:105.0%" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Decision tree for determining whether you
qualify as a bureaucrat.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The consequence of subjectivity is that everything is negotiable.
Bureaucracy relies on negotiation to adjust to nuanced circumstances not
foreseen when policies were designed. You (whether in the role of either
a subject or a bureaucrat) need to know both who to negotiate with and
how to negotiate changes you seek.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is made up, but there are actual rules that constrain us.
The mathematical physics that describe nature are not negotiable.
Everything in your environment is either naturally occurring macroscopic
emergent phenomena (e.g., chemistry, biology) or humans making up labels
and norms. Distinguishing the two is critical to knowing what you can
change and what you have to work within.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy arises when there is no common, objectively quantifiable
feedback mechanism for individual participants in the organization. This
aspect is why governments, schools, and prisons are characterized as
bureaucratic. The military doesn’t rank soldiers by “number of enemies
killed” and is bureaucratic. Even profit-driven commercial organizations
are bureaucratic when the actions of individual employees are not
coupled to the metrics of profit.</p>
<p>Profit-based feedback makes some roles in a business context slightly
more predictable and understandable. Even in that situation there are
subjective trade-offs like what costs get externalized and whether to
focus on long-term profit versus short-term profit.</p>
<p>The concept of bureaucracy is most visible for complex recurring
situations involving many people and the control of a shared resource.
The apparent friction of bureaucratic processes can be lower when there
are only a few people involved (“I’m just talking to my collaborator" or
“I’m just buying groceries from a clerk at the store” or “I’m using a
website for a government service”), but there is a continuous gradient
to more obvious instances of bureaucracy. Bureaucratic tendencies are
observable at the small scale but in that limit it becomes difficult to
distinguish what is attributable to the participants involved.</p>
<p>Operating within an organization of bureaucrats feels different from
other parts of your life because of the apparent interdependence and
loss of autonomy. Modern conveniences are designed to hide bureaucracy
and create the illusion of independence. Aspects of modern life like
electricity, water, sewage, safety, and entertainment all operate at a
scale that makes dependence on other humans almost invisible. You
probably don’t know the person who wired your house, runs the electrical
power plant, monitors the flow of clean water, or treats sewage. A
breakdown of those services is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leaky
abstraction</a>.</p>
<p> <br />
Bureaucracy arises when management of a shared resource is necessary.
That resource can be external to the organization or internal to the
organization. Examples of external shared resources include mail
delivery for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service">USPS</a>,
public safety for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation">FBI</a>,
and the environment for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">EPA</a>.
The focus of this book is on resources internal to an organization.
Intangible resources internal to a bureaucratic organization include
attention, skill, and expertise. Those shared internal resources get
quantified as time, money, and staffing. While talking about time and
money and staffing are easy to make trade-offs with, keep in mind they
are proxy measures for the central intangible resources.</p>
<p> <br />
Bureaucracy is a system for distributed knowledge and distributed
decision making. That is in contrast to easier-to-understand concepts
like centralized knowledge and centralized decision making. A government
run by dictatorship is easy to conceptualize compared to democracies
because there is a central character around which a narrative can be
formed. Similarly, stories about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> of
a company are much easier than capturing the thousands of interactions
conducted by the many employees of that company. The vast majority of
the work an organization does is coordinated and carried out by people
other than the CEO. Most of what is known within an organization is
known by people other than the CEO. Linear story-telling with a small
number of main characters does not map well to the complexities of
bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 id="scope-of-bureaucracy">Scope of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is a trait of an organization: we call organizations
bureaucratic. This is consistent with the definition of bureaucracy
based on managing <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span>. Examples of
organizations considered bureaucratic include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection
Agency</a> (EPA) manages access to bureaucrats who have expertise with
environmental regulations governing water, air, workplace safety,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.intelligence.gov/">United States
Intelligence Community</a> manages access to bureaucrats who have
expertise in collecting foreign intelligence.</p></li>
<li><p>The information technology department in a large organization
manages staff with expertise in repairing computers.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats in the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug
Administration</a> (FDA) use their expertise regulating the safety of
food to serve their community.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats of the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/">Federal
Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) have expertise on flight safety to
protect their community.</p></li>
<li><p>The military manages the shared resource of bureaucrats with
expertise in war-making.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These descriptions of bureaucracy are conceptually consistent but
don’t provide value to you, the practicing bureaucrat. Bureaucracy is
not a distant faceless concept. Bureaucracy permeates your environment
and is the basis for many interactions you have with other people.</p>
<p>When you recognize bureaucracy specific to your environment, you will
be able to respond appropriately. If you recognize the systemic
incentives driving a person’s behavior, you are less likely to see the
person as malicious or incompetent.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="who-is-a-bureaucrat">Who is a
Bureaucrat?</h3>
<p>A cashier in a gas station is a bureaucrat. The shared resource is
the gas and other items for sale. The “policy” might simply be “take
money from customer in exchange for items sold in the store and gas from
the pumps,” but the subjective application of that policy leaves a lot
of room for the cashier to shape the customer’s experience. Does the
cashier greet the customer when the customer enters the store? Does the
cashier look at the customer to acknowledge the customer? Smile? How
quickly does the cashier engage the customer? Minor nuances that are
left to the cashier in the execution of the store policy means there is
room for subjective application of the policy.</p>
<p>A bank teller, a loan officer, and a bank’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support">technical
support</a> are all bureaucrats. The shared resource includes the money
managed by the bank and the expertise associated with managing money.
Each employee subjectively enforces policies on behalf of the
organization. Each role has a different amount of impact on the bank’s
finances. Of these three roles, the loan officer’s interactions with
bank customers provides the clearest route for feedback based on profit.
The loan officer doesn’t act alone though – the customer’s interactions
with tellers and the bank’s technical systems also matter to the
customer’s decision about how and where to manage money.</p>
<p>This same discretionary application of policy applies to commercial
bureaucrats like sandwich makers, car salespeople, oil well drillers,
grocery clerks, retail clerks, and plumbers. Public school teachers,
state and federal police, military members, tax collectors, and other
state workers are government bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Factory line workers subjectively apply policies, with the assembly
line and factory being the shared resource. Enforcement of quality
standards is a subjective policy. Pacing of work is a negotiation with
management that directly impacts productivity and profits. The feedback
loop for factory workers from profit generated by the product is weak
and diffuse.</p>
<p>Structured environments like sports featuring well defined rules do
not eliminate bureaucracy. Teammates use subjective policies on who to
work with and how to best leverage their strengths and exploit the
opponent’s weaknesses. The policies are set in part by the coach.
Referees make subjective determinations about rules.</p>
<p>Sometimes bureaucrats do not work directly with customers or citizens
or products. Then the bureaucratic process is inflicted on fellow
bureaucrats. In that scenario, a bureaucrat is subjectively applying a
policy to other bureaucrats.</p>

detailed evaluation.</p>
<p> <br />
Identifying yourself as a bureaucrat matters because the label informs
the responsibilities of the role. The risk of not self-identifying as a
bureaucrat is that you won’t grasp how much control you have in enacting
and enforcing policy. If you think of yourself as having to blindly
follow rules, you will harm the people you are applying the rules to and
you will harm the organization you are applying the rules for. The value
of having capacity for judgement is so you can adapt policies to
circumstances.</p>
<p>In a similar sense from the consumer’s or citizen’s perspective, if
you don’t think you are interacting with a bureaucracy, you won’t
perceive the opportunity to negotiate. If you view rules as unchanging
and inflexible, you will harm your ability to make progress. If a rule
was made by a human, then that rule is flexible. Who made the rule? Who
enforces the rule? If you can talk to them, could they be convinced to
make a modification or an exception?</p>
<p>If you don’t think about the bureaucratic framing, you might think
the store clerk is enforcing a policy because they don’t like you.
Assigning personality conflict as the cause might lead to a different
conversation with their manager (the person who created the policy).</p>
<p>If you don’t think of yourself as a bureaucrat, you’ll behave
differently in your job. The paradigm of “just tell me what to do” is
the default (learned in school) and you won’t know how to engage with
coworkers and bosses since their role is distinct from that of a friend.
You will be less likely to understand how to leverage members of your
organization. Thinking from the perspective of a bureaucrat explains why
communicating within your organization is critical to your own success
and the success of the organization.</p>
<p>If you think of yourself as merely a cog in a machine, you are less
likely to notice that you exert influence in the process and you are
less likely to recognize the autonomy available to you. If you think “I
have a real job (e.g., nurse, cashier, teacher), therefore I’m not a
bureaucrat", you are less likely to recognize the subjective power you
have in interactions with the public. If you think, “I’m at the bottom
of my organization’s hierarchy, therefore I do not have power", you are
less likely to notice autonomy when it is available.</p>
<p>If you don’t think of yourself as part of a bureaucratic process,
you’ll behave differently in interactions with bureaucrats. You won’t
perceive opportunities to negotiate because the processes seem fixed
instead of subjective. You won’t recognize motives and incentives of
bureaucrats, so their activities will seem incomprehensible.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="factors-influencing-bureaucracy">Factors
Influencing Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Although bureaucracy can be present for one person, and bureaucracy
is often apparent on teams (e.g., 3 to 20 people), this book focuses on
the situation of multiple teams comprising an organization. This might
be a few hundred people (above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>) up to millions of people. Examples of companies that employ
more than a million people<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> include Walmart, Amazon,
and McDonald’s. Size isn’t a requirement for bureaucracy. Small
companies with a few people incur bureaucracy because of the need for
coordination of subjective policies governing shared resources.</p>
<p>Money is uncorrelated with bureaucracy. Bureaucracy occurs in
commercial companies, government, and non-profit organizations. Money
can help align incentives and provide feedback loops to inform behavior,
but it can also be the source of administrivia and policies.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy emerges in small organizations, has patterns that are
scale invariant, and is generic across sectors. The complexity of the
tasks may be different, but the same scale-independent patterns emerge
because of a common factor: human behavior.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy scales with the complexity associated with a shared
resource. For example, if participants in a society only used hand tools
they could make themselves, then there is little need for bureaucracy.
Mining and producing small amounts of metal is feasible for an
individual, though the relevance of specialization becomes clearer. A
society large enough to support the technology of writing (beyond the
use of clay tablets) seems to coincide with the bureaucratic need for
writing. Getting to technology like the telegraph and radio requires a
society that supports complex processes and specialization – key
features of bureaucratic systems. While decreasing accidental
bureaucracy is certainly feasible, there’s some essential bureaucracy<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> necessary for maintaining the
current level of technological sophistication.</p>
<p>In addition to essential task complexity, the size of bureaucracy
depends on accidental factors like how old the bureaucracy is, how big
the community being supported is, and how diverse the community is.</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals-of-bureaucracy">Fundamentals of Bureaucracy<span
id="sec:fundamentals-of-b" label="sec:fundamentals-of-b"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is a system of distributed knowledge and distributed
decision making for managing shared resources. The decision making is
not purely logical; it relies on particular facets of human interaction.
This section outlines the critical roles of decision making, hierarchy,
communication in bureaucracy, and feedback loops. My list is smaller
than Max Weber’s <span class="citation" data-cites="2015_Weber">(Weber
2015)</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and I see bureaucracy as more
widespread.</p>
<p><a href="#sec:decision-making">Decision making</a></p>
<p>is central to bureaucracy. Every other aspect of bureaucracy derives
from decision making. The decision making in bureaucracy is with respect
to the subjective management of resources. In my definition of
bureaucracy, “<span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span>” refers to both
expertise and tangible goods like air, water, and land.</p>
<p>When there are multiple people present, or even when one person is
trying to be self-consistent, coordination of decision making is
important to the management of shared resources. Who gets to make which
decision is managed using <a
href="#sec:hierarchy-of-roles">hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>While coordination can occur without hierarchy when there are a small
number of people, typically an organization of people leads to both
formal and informal hierarchies.</p>
<p><a href="#sec:meetings-for-coordination">Meetings</a> and <a
href="#sec:written-communication">written communication</a> help with
consensus among bureaucrats, though agreement isn’t necessarily the
outcome. Once a decision is made, the choice selected by a bureaucrat
propagates throughout the organization to achieve some level of
consistency.</p>
<p>A less obvious feature of bureaucracy is the weak <span
data-acronym-label="feedback loop"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">feedback loop</span>. This
distinguishes bureaucracy from a market-based system where the
consequences of decisions manifest as profits and losses. If you sell
shoes, you can evaluate decisions you’ve made by measuring how much
money you make. In contrast, the decisions of a bureaucrat are barely
felt by the bureaucrat. That weak feedback loop (few consequences for
the decision maker) means learning from mistakes is harder and positive
reinforcement for good outcomes is negligible. A weak feedback loop does
not mean there are no consequences. The actions of a bureaucrat create
ripples that are felt by other people. This is described in more detail
in the section on <a href="#sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples">feedback
loops and ripples</a> on page .</p>
<p> <br />
If you’re not an academic researcher of bureaucracy, you might be
thinking that you don’t want to have to think about hierarchy or
collaboration or coordination. Meetings and email are not your goal; you
just want to do the tasks that you were trained for.</p>
<p>As you progressed through school you were graded as an individual
student. Now that you are employed your job has pay, promotion,
hiring/firing, and a title. School, and now employment, may see focused
on your individual abilities. The following sections explain why the
individualist mentality is ineffective when you are part of a system of
distributed knowledge and distributed decision making.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="decision-making-in-a-bureaucracy">Decision
Making in a Bureaucracy<span id="sec:decision-making"
label="sec:decision-making"></span></h3>
<p>Decisions are central to the operation of a bureaucratic
organization. In this book we explore the topic of decisions, but
decisions are not the only source of change in an organization.
Occasionally events unfold without decisions being made either because
the decision makers are not informed, or there is an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willful_blindness">intentional
neglect</a>. This book focuses on situations where bureaucrats recognize
the need for a decision and want to make the best decision.</p>
<p>There are multiple types of decisions. A <span
data-acronym-label="simple decision"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">simple decision</span> has one
correct or beneficial choice and one or more wrong or harmful choices.
The work of decision making is then to gather information that
identifies which is the correct or beneficial choice and select that
option.</p>
<p>The best case scenario for any decision making is one person making a
well-informed simple decision that has immediate consequence and the
consequence is to the decision maker. Examples from elementary school
include arithmetic math problems, multiple choice quizzes, spelling
tests, and memorization tests. A bureaucrat’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_injury">moral injury</a> comes
from decision making that involves multiple people, weak feedback loops
with high latency, and complex decisions having multiple objectives.</p>
<h4 id="example-decision-method-pareto-frontier">Example Decision
Method: Pareto Frontier<span id="sec:pareto"
label="sec:pareto"></span></h4>
<p>A complex decision may have many choices, and there are might not be
a best option. There are formal techniques for navigating the process of
arriving at a result. One approach for describing the situation is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front">Pareto frontier</a>.
If a Pareto frontier exists, then trade-offs can be evaluated.</p>
<p>As an example of a complex decision made by one person with immediate
consequence and direct relevance to the decision maker, suppose you want
to buy a car. You care about only two aspects: fuel efficiency and cost.
See Figure <a href="#fig:pareto_frontier_cars" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:pareto_frontier_cars">2.2</a> for an example of the
Pareto frontier.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="images/pareto_frontier_car_options.png"
id="fig:pareto_frontier_cars" style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Four cars: L, M, N, and P. The goal of
the buyer is to spend less money (lower on the vertical axis) and get
better fuel efficiency (right on the horizontal axis). Choices not on
the frontier should be avoided, but that doesn’t yield a single
result.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Visualizing a Pareto frontier for two quantitative variables is easy,
but typically decisions involve more factors. For example, evaluating
the trade-off of three quantitative variables like passenger capacity,
cost, and fuel efficiency creates a surface. With more than three
variables visualization are less useful, though the analysis technique
still applies.</p>
<p>Another constraint on using Pareto frontier analysis is that it works
well when there are many options relative to the number of variables
being optimized for. The assessment does not work as well when there are
few choices relative to the number of variables. For example, suppose
there are five choices of car and you want high fuel efficiency,
sufficient cargo capacity, maximum number of passengers, stylish, low
cost, low maintenance, good durability, and high resale value. Then
defining a Pareto frontier is less helpful.</p>
<p>For a set of quantitative variables, a Pareto frontier does not
account for the relative importance of different variables. Assigning
weights to each of these factors merely stretches one axis relative to
the other axes.</p>
<p>There are many possible decision making frameworks besides Pareto
frontiers, but in practice a typical bureaucratic decision is
ill-informed, has diffuse consequences, delayed impact, and does not
affect the decision maker. In bureaucratic processes there is rarely a
formal assessment of options. Decisions are rarely recorded. Even
afterwards a decision can be difficult to evaluate for correctness
because there are multiple stakeholders.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: If the people you want to convince are not swayed by
data, then you can augment the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit
analysis</a> with stories.</p>
<h4 id="risks-of-using-decision-frameworks">Risks of Using Decision
Frameworks</h4>
<p>Decision making frameworks can be attractive to bureaucrats intending
to formalize <a href="#sec:process">processes</a> and encourage
predictability. There are potential risks worth being aware of.
Cost-benefit analysis can decrease the apparent responsibility of the
decision maker. Cost-benefit analysis can be used to deflect criticism
for an action.</p>
<p>A decision is political when the basis is historical relationships,
maintenance or creation of a relationship, or to enable future
relationships. A decision is subjective when someone else faced with the
same scenario would have come to a different conclusion. A decision is
quantitative when based on measurements. To avoid the appearance of
subjective decision making or political decision making, a decision may
be framed as “data driven." A good approach for data driven quantitative
analysis involves coming up with a testable hypothesis, pre-registering
what actions are to be taken after assessing the results, then
performing experiments and collecting data to evaluate the
hypothesis.</p>
<p>More commonly, a decision is made, then data is gathered which
supports the desired outcome. Forming an opinion and then looking for
evidence to back the outcome yields suboptimal results for the
organization. The value to the individual using that suboptimal approach
is extracted from other members of the organization or subjects of the
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Even when a bureaucrat is not intentionally biased towards an
outcome, there are many ways to gather evidence. Some approaches have
biased sampling and produce biased results.</p>
<p>Even with valid and representative data measurement, decision makers
can be led astray by poor modeling. A model may use inapplicable
techniques, or may have implementation bugs.</p>
<p>For all the dangers of decision making methods, there are worse
approaches that do not rely on measurement. People rely on history (if
they are aware of it) and perpetuate bad ideas, or take action based on
what is best for their career, or decide based on how to accumulate more
power, or simply choose based on what someone else says to do.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-decision-making-approaches">Alternative Decision
Making Approaches</h4>
<p>Identifying the spectrum of ways bureaucrats make decisions can
decrease the surprise when you encounter the approaches in practice.

<h4 id="why-cost-benefit-analysis-models-are-not-used">Why cost-benefit
analysis models are not used</h4>
<p>Applying quantitative models to decision making may seem a useful
path to optimal outcomes. Improved decision making that benefits
stakeholders seems attractive. There are a variety of reasons this
approach is not taken. I outline the reasoning here not out of cynicism,
but so that you can appropriately respond when confronted with arguments
against <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit
modeling</a>. Decreasing your surprise through the inoculation of
exposure enables you to develop counter-arguments.</p>
<p>One reason to avoid cost-benefit modeling is that there is a lot of
work to do, so coming up with a model is an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity
cost</a>. Modeling every decision in detail is unrealistic, so triage is
needed – which decisions warrant what degree of investment in analysis.
A person inexperienced in modeling decisions will take longer and is
more likely to create a bad model. Practice designing models is
expensive. Identifying relevant parameters for inclusion in a model is a
learnable skill.</p>
<p>If a person has a bad experience with cost-benefit modeling, they may
be less likely to try again with other decisions. Bad experiences can
come from using incorrect data, missing a critical variable, picking the
wrong scope for a question, implementing the right model with the wrong
math, misinterpreting the result, using a model that is too in-depth or
not sufficiently deep, or failing to sell the result of an analysis to
stakeholders.</p>
<p>Quantitative cost-benefit modeling doesn’t account for personalities
or organizational politics. The best options may decrease the decider’s
power or prestige, or harm relationships.</p>
<p>To inform a cost-benefit analysis, measurements are needed. In
addition to measurement being costly, measurements get perverted – see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law">Campbell’s
law</a>.</p>
<h4 id="decision-making-delay">Decision Making Delay<span

a decision, change processes, disseminate their choice, and justify

</ul>
<h4 id="a-bureaucratic-decision-involves-many-decisions">A Bureaucratic
Decision involves many Decisions</h4>
<p>A decision is a collection of interdependent choices. After
recognizing the need for a decision, follow-on decisions include
identifying the stakeholders (who to include in an analysis) and
identifying options. Who is a stakeholder and what are the options are
interrelated. Involving more people expands the number of options and
the complexity of coordination. Additional choices associated with
reducing uncertainty are how much time to spend on the decision, how
much information to gather for the decision, whether the make the
decision or push the decision to someone with more expertise, or whether
to push the decision to someone with more exposure to the
consequences.</p>
<p>Most decisions you make as a bureaucrat do not have hard deadlines.
Instead, there are trade-offs in allocation of your attention. Sooner is
preferable since the consequence of the decision benefits the
organization and allows you to focus on other tasks, but delaying allows
for more information gathering for a better informed decision. See
Dilemma <a href="#table:gather-data-lots-vs-little"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:gather-data-lots-vs-little">4.18</a> on page  and
other related Dilemmas in section <a href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:dilemma-trilemma">[sec:dilemma-trilemma]</a>.</p>
<p>If a bureaucrat is going to rely on consulting an <a
href="#sec:expertise">expert</a>, the decision maker needs to be
confident the expert is not of straying outside their area of expertise.
For example, I don’t rely on a botanist to tell me how to change the oil
in my car. Besides knowing their own limitations, the expert should be
clear about whether their input is a factual summary, a predictive
assessment, or a value judgement. This complicates what you as a
bureaucrat are interested in when deciding what’s the best choice.</p>
<h4 id="transparency-of-decision-making">Transparency of Decision
Making<span id="sec:transparency-of-decisions"
label="sec:transparency-of-decisions"></span></h4>
<p>Your decision making process might change if made visible to
stakeholders. You may provide clearer justifications, or spend more time
gathering evidence to support a claim. Strengthening the arguments is
beneficial but takes time and resources.</p>
<p>Frank conversations and exploratory brainstorming need protections to
allow participants to be vulnerable. This is the motive for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House
Rule</a>. The concept of transparency can apply before a decision is
issued, while a policy is in effect, or after the consequence (as part
of a review). Making decisions as part of a transparent process can make
participants more risk averse because of the potential for failure.</p>
<p>People affected by the decisions benefit from understanding how the
decisions were made – see examples like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_in_the_Sunshine_Act">Sunshine
laws</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)">FoIA</a>.

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="hierarchy-of-roles">Hierarchy of Roles<span
id="sec:hierarchy-of-roles" label="sec:hierarchy-of-roles"></span></h3>
<p>In an ideal situation, sufficient depth and breath for decision
making would be embodied in one person. That might not be possible in
every situation. One way to resolve this is to identify distinct scopes
of responsibility and then assign different members of an organization
separate scopes for decision making. Within a decision making scope
there may be more work than one person can handle, so a team is formed.
That team may have some members focused on tactical work and other
members focused on strategy and coordination. Hierarchy within an
organization is the formalization of separate decision-making scopes and
associated specialization.</p>
<p>Partitioning knowledge and decision making enables complex work
beyond what one person can accomplish and causes friction among members.
An expert reporting to a manager knows things the manager does not, and
the manager may have context that the expert lacks. Both bureaucrats
(the expert and the manager) need to convey their respective
understanding and seek the holistic view.</p>
<p>Hierarchical decision making is one option for coordination among
alternatives (like consensus), so why is hierarchy so common? Members of
an organization gravitate towards hierarchy because it helps define task
scope, assigns responsibility, and obviates a need for building
consensus. Reaching consensus for every decision would take time and be
more burdensome than appointing a person as the decision maker.</p>
<p> <br />
A hierarchical organization with partitioned knowledge introduces a
challenge: the order in which you share information with others matters.
Your choices for who to first describe an idea to are your peers, your
management, and your subordinates. The people subordinate to you know
more about the topic and are exposed to the consequences. Giving them a
chance to vet the idea results in a more robust idea and validates their
value in the organization. Alternatively, first sharing your idea with
management allows your superiors to provide context you might not be
aware off. And choosing to first start the conversation with your peers
indicates you value the relationship and decreases the risk of
duplicating work.</p>
<p> <br />
I’ve included hierarchy in the section on Fundamentals of Bureaucracy,
but that does not imply that hierarchy is a required feature of
bureaucracy. Hierarchies of bureaucrats are a common <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure">organizational
structure</a> and are worth studying even if not essential to
bureaucracy. The relevance of understanding hierarchy is to identify
recurring behavior and patterns to leverage. Organizations of
bureaucrats can intentionally work against the use of hierarchy for
decisions, but the amount of effort needed to enable alternatives
results in hierarchy being a common approach.</p>
<p>The benefits of formal hierarchy include improved capacity for the
number of policy decisions made, enabling consistency of decisions, and
leveraging specialization of knowledge. Hierarchical decision making has
costs: higher latency (compared to a single decider), inconsistency
among bureaucrats (dissemination isn’t perfect), waste due to
inefficiency, and <a href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">many
others</a>.</p>
<p>As another example of the potential for harm, hierarchy enables
strategic ignorance. Bureaucrats in positions of power can deny having
knowledge of improper activity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Whether that is a
problem or benefit depends on your role.</p>
<p>The structure of an organization is dynamic, but at each point in
time an organization typically has a defined set of roles. Each role is
distinguished by different scopes of decision authority. Roles are often
confused with titles. What matters is the role (scope of decisions) and
who reports to whom. The names of teams can be similarly not
descriptive.</p>
<p>Roles in an organization are defined by the boundaries of
responsibility. The purpose of a role is to minimize conflict, decrease
the need for coordination, reduce redundancy, and allow for control of
resources. Clear boundaries of responsibility enable effective
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>A conventional characterization of an organization’s hierarchy
involves two criteria: the depth and breadth of the <span
data-acronym-label="org chart" data-acronym-form="singular+short">org
chart</span>. The more people a supervisor oversees, the flatter the
organization – that’s the breadth of the organization. The depth of the
hierarchy is how many layers there are. See the Valve handbook <span
class="citation" data-cites="2012_Valve">(unknown 2012)</span> and
Joreen’s essay <span class="citation" data-cites="1972_Joreen">(Freeman
1972)</span> for contrasting views on the merits of an organization’s
hierarchy.</p>
<p>A more practical view of an organization’s hierarchy also involves
two criteria. The two choices of how a hierarchy is shaped are 1) how
many people a supervisor oversees and 2) how many supervisors a person
has. You might naively expect that an employee has one boss, but that is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management">not a
requirement</a>. A supervisor for a given topic may have many people
reporting to them, and a bureaucrat with multiple roles may report to
more than one supervisor.</p>
<p> <br />
Acting as part of a group means ceding part of your autonomy. Hierarchy
cedes some of your responsibility and adds expectations about
relationships. The consequence of hierarchy in an organization is that,
as a member of the bureaucracy, you do not have full autonomy –
otherwise you would not be a member of the hierarchy. At the same time,
you are not under strict control of the organization – you still have
some subjective decision making authority as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The person at the top of the hierarchy does not know everything. The
person at the top of the hierarchy does not have input on every decision
made in the organization. Some autonomy is retained by all members of
the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Independent of the defined roles and titles in an organization’s
hierarchy, there are a set of implicit roles and a separate social
hierarchy of informal influencers and decision makers. Informal
influencers in a bureaucracy usually have long relationships with the
decision maker or relevant credentials or both. The credentials can be
formal (e.g., a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy">PhD</a>) or
informal (demonstrated success on a project). In either case, the
decision maker is relying on another person’s expertise.</p>
<p>Another set of informal relationships within an organization is
mentors and mentees. These relations allow mentors to share
institutional knowledge to mentees, and allow people in senior positions
to access the novice perspective.</p>
<p> <br />
One consequence of hierarchy is a sense of fear felt by people who
report to other people. This fear stems from the loss of control (less
autonomy) that leaves the person feeling disempowered.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following relationship. Sue is perceived to
have power over another person, Amy, because Amy gave up some control to
Sue. Amy not having full control over decisions triggers the feeling of
fear in Amy, regardless of how Sue behaves. Having complete
responsibility for decisions also induces anxiety.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sue and Amy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If Sue is aware of the potential for this emotional experience, Sue
can compensate for Amy’s fear by being friendly and receptive towards
Amy. Alternatively Sue may exploit or rely on the fear felt by
subordinates. Sue not noticing or accounting for Amy’s fear does not
invalidate Amy’s emotional experience.</p>

Guide and a Lie<span id="sec:org-chart-as-guide-and-lie"

<p>An <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart">organizational
chart</a> (hereafter an “<span data-acronym-label="org chart"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">org chart</span>”) identifies formal
roles and the formal relations among roles. An org chart is at best a
snapshot in time, and more often aspirational than descriptive. In spite
of possible deficiencies, an org chart helps outsiders and newcomers
understand the scope of responsibilities and interactions.<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Org charts are a lie in the sense that undocumented relationships can
matter more than the official roles. Org charts fail to capture the
informal roles and network of relations that facilitate progress in any
organization. Org charts document titles instead of describing
roles.</p>
<p>Org charts foster a second separate lie by creating a sense of power
dynamics based on visual orientation. For more on this issue see the

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="meetings-for-coordination">Meetings for
Coordination<span id="sec:meetings-for-coordination"
label="sec:meetings-for-coordination"></span></h3>
<p>In an organization comprised of more than one person, meetings are
necessary to facilitate coordination. The coordination accomplished by a
meeting can be explicit (verbal or written), or it can be indirect
through signaling (who attended the meeting, when the meeting was held,
where the meeting was held, how much notice was provided).</p>
<p>Not everyone understands that meetings are a vital aspect of
coordination in a bureaucracy. The following sequence of scenarios
illustrate the thinking some bureaucrats use. If you’re already
convinced of the value of meetings, see <a
href="#sec:well-run-meeting">tips on improvement</a> on page .</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: No plan or coordination needed; I just do
what you tell me. With this approach, either I will be successful
because I worked hard on what my supervisor directed, or I will fail
because I was directed to do the wrong thing by my supervisor.<br />
<em>Potential response 1 by the supervisor</em>: I think you’re smart,
and I think you’re capable of shaping your career. Let’s work as a team
to improve your effectiveness.<br />
<em>Potential response 2 by the supervisor</em>: Is that how you want
your career to go? Do you desire autonomy and creativity?</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: No point in making a plan or coordinating
because everything changes so often.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: But the work has an end
goal, right?<br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: Yes, so then the plan is to get from where
we are now to that end goal. Coordinate as necessary.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: And there are no
intermediary steps? Milestones? Is it better to have no plans and just
put out fires as a reaction, or to have a plan with contingencies that
are subject to change?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Meeting to discuss the value of
coordination.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> <br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: What is a plan anyways?<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: There is value in
collaboratively specifying a goal, enumerating tasks that would support
the goal, identifying the dependencies among the sub-tasks, and
time-binning the dependencies with defined milestones and deliverables.
That is my definition of a plan. And having that is more useful than
merely reacting.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: Who’s plan? Who’s relationships? I don’t
need to come up with that plan, the supervisor already has a plan. Just
tell me what the plan is.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: That’s not as effective
as coming up with independent plans and then resolving the differences.
There’s value in resolving the differences, even though that will cost
time and frustration and displace time to enact the plan.</p>
<p> <br />
Not every team member in a bureaucracy is against planning, or as
obstinate about collaboration. My intent for sharing these debates is
that you will be less surprised when they are raised by your
coworkers.</p>

<p>Paperwork, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape">red
tape</a>, and modern electronic forms are closely associated with
bureaucracy. Digital reports, spreadsheets, and emails are the current
technological artifacts of an organization’s bureaucracy. Regardless of
format, a written record creates evidence about policies,
justifications, and decisions. While written records are burdensome to
create and maintain and search, they are not intrinsically good or
bad.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="feedback-loops-and-ripples">Feedback loops
and Ripples<span id="sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples"
label="sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples"></span></h3>
<p>A feedback loop exists when a decision maker experiences the harms
and benefits of their decision. Decisions that lack a feedback loop
still have consequences for the decision maker, in that potential future
decisions are altered or limited <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Virtuous cycles and vicious cycles are rare in bureaucratic
organizations because there are rarely mechanisms for feedback loops.
Instead, there are <span data-acronym-label="ripple"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">ripples</span> – propagation of
consequences for other people’s schedules, altering what is possible for
other people, and creating dependent tasks to be carried out by people
other than the decision maker.</p>
<p>The weak feedback mechanisms for a bureaucrat are reputation (subject
to spin) and rarely enforced retroactive accountability in the form of
the question, “What did you know and when did you know it?” Retroactive
accountability depends on written records from meeting notes, emails,
agendas, and reports. Reducing the potential for retroactive
accountability is one motive for bureaucrats avoiding written records
for decisions and policies.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of quantitative feedback loops for bureaucrats,
there is significant interest in documenting justification, proactive
monitoring, reporting, and retroactive assessment. Each of those
activities creates more administrivia.</p>
<p>When there are multiple competing objectives among different
stakeholders in a zero sum use of resources, how can you determine
what’s best? In some domains there are feedback loops to guide progress.
When feedback loops are weak or not present, then the most powerful
stakeholder (which is distinct from the biggest or loudest) will
dominate.</p>
<p> <br />
Because feedback loops are weak for decision makers, alternative
mechanisms are needed in bureaucracy. A standard approach is the use of
approvals and justifications. The strength of justification needed for a
given action depends on your relationship with the approver and the
potential ripples associated with the action.</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="special-interest-groups">Special interest
groups</h4>
<p>Within bureaucratic organizations there are special interest groups
that care about aspects of the shared resource central to the
organization. When there is a benefit to a small group and the cost is
to a larger group, inefficiency can occur.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_trap">social
trap</a> is “a conflict of interest or perverse incentive where
individuals or a group of people act to obtain short-term individual
gains, which in the long run leads to a loss for the group as a whole."
The feedback loop for the diffused value relevant to the organization is
weaker than the feedback loop for value to the interest group.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="spending-taxpayer-dollars">Spending taxpayer
dollars</h4>
<p>As an example of a weak feedback loop, consider the scenario of a
government employee deciding how to spend government money.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Suppose you are a government bureaucrat and earn $100,000 with a tax
rate of 30%. Then your tax money sent to the government is $30,000. How
does that compare to what the government collects in taxes?</p>
<p>For the United States, “in 2021 the government collected $4.05
trillion in revenue." <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>That means your taxes of $30,000 would be 30000/4050000000000 =
0.00000074% of the tax base for the country.</p>
<p>If you are a federal government bureaucrat and you do not maximize
the effectiveness of spending $1,000,000 of government money, of that
misallocated money only $0.0074, or about one penny, was taxes you paid.
The financial feedback loop is weak.</p>
<p>Some federal government bureaucrat earn slightly more, so the cost of
wasting $1,000,000 is more significant. Federal pay is limited to about
$220,000<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, so that raises the feedback to 2
pennies.</p>
</div>
<p>The lack of feedback allows waste to go unfelt. There’s no immediate
consequence for the decision maker.</p>
<p> <br />
Example feedback loop:</p>

<h4
id="example-feedback-loop-security-agent-making-a-fair-decision">Example
feedback loop: Security agent making a fair decision</h4>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>A coworker and I were going through passport control at an airport.
There was a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration">TSA
officer</a> directing people into one of two lines. Both lines were
long. The length of each line were not equal even though the entry to
the lines is at the same location. Each line terminated at a collection
of passport checking agents. Each passport check took a minute. Passport
checking TSA officers operate independently and concurrently.</p>
<p>The TSA officer’s perspective is that there are two long lines. His
procedure is two balance the two lines (for fairness). He does this by
pointing people into one of the two lines, with his choice driven which
line appears to have room available.</p>
<p>My coworker and I enter the controlled area and are directed into
lines by the TSA officer. My coworker is directed left and I’m directed
to go right. The TSA officer’s job is completed.</p>
<p>My coworker in the left line finishes 5 minutes before me. This
difference in completion time is frustrating for me.</p>
<p>Because the lines are not of equal length, balancing the start of the
line is an suboptimal method. The consequence is that what seems fair to
the TSA officer ends up not being fair for people going through the
line. The TSA officer had incomplete information – the lines are not of
equal length. Because the TSA officer isn’t exposed to the consequence
of his approach, he doesn’t get feedback on whether it is suboptimal or
not.</p>
</div>
<p>Lesson: if the people making decisions do not experience the
consequences of those decisions, then they have no incentive to improve
decision making.</p>
<p>The person in the longer line feels frustrated. The negative feeling
is due to a sense of powerlessness, and that the situation is recurring,
and a better solution is available.</p>
<p>The optimal solution in this situation is to have a single line
feeding the multiple TSA passport checkers. This eliminates the need for
the decision maker but incurs work to change the status quo.</p>
<h4 id="parking-garage">Parking garage</h4>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Bob parks his car in a parking garage every day. The parking garage
owner charges $20 per day for people to park their car.</p>
<p>Bob recently found that one of the exit gates for the parking garage
is broken. If Bob uses that gate to leave the parking garage, the gate
does not function and Bob cannot exit. Then Bob has to call the parking
gate operator to request an exception (which is granted) and Bob can
then exit that gate, avoiding the $20/day charge.</p>
<p>This action (go to broken gate, request exception, avoid charge) has
been repeated for a long time (months). Bob’s motive is to avoid the $20
parking charge; the cost is a mere phone call and a minor delay. This
cheating behavior harms the parking garage owner’s income. However, the
parking gate operator, serving as intermediary, insulates the parking
garage owner from the interaction with the cheater. The cheating
behavior is small enough that the parking garage owner may not
notice.</p>
</div>
<p>Having an intermediary policy enforcer alleviates the need for the
garage owner to interact with customers. If the incentives of
stakeholders are not aligned then inefficiency goes unchecked. If the
parking garage operator’s profits are a fixed-rate rather than tied to
parking charges, then the operator lacks motive to fix problems.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-bureaucracy">History of Bureaucracy<span

<p>Bureaucracy has repeatedly arisen independently in a variety of
cultures <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"

the lifespan of one person<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. That indicates the
current situation is not a fluke or coincidence. There is some utility
(or pathology) that is consistently recurring.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy predates writing and language and even humans! Subjective
policy enforcement in support of an organization arises in pre-human
tribes, visible in groups of modern apes who have to manage access to
shared resources <span class="citation" data-cites="2016_Suchak">(Suchak
et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Though bureaucracy is not new, the pervasiveness is. Prior to the
industrial revolution the scale of both employment and government were
small organizations limited by the speed of communication. For the past
100+ years the size of organizations (commercial and governmental and
academia) have grown beyond <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s

bureaucratic. Driving this increase is the support for more complex
products and processes.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-bureaucracy-is-nearly-impossible">Avoiding Bureaucracy
is Nearly Impossible</h2>
<p>The only situation where bureaucracy might not exist is if you live
completely on your own and have no interaction with other people. That
means completely disengaging from society. Even then, personal routines
are a self-imposed form of bureaucracy, with the roles of policy maker,
bureaucrat, and subject collapsed to a single person – you.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency and autonomy are attractive alternatives
bureaucracy. The way participants in modern society strive for
self-sufficiency is by denying their dependence on modern society.
That’s a relabeling of selfishness which feels better.</p>
<p>For the rest of us who operate as members of a society, bureaucracy
is necessary for our rights. You validate your name using paperwork and
forms and records. These artifacts are used, in cooperation with other
people, to determine your claim citizenship and associated rights.
That’s a subjective policy that <span data-acronym-label="stakeholder"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">stakeholders</span> in society agree
to.</p>
<p>The necessity of bureaucracy, and the reason it is culturally
invariant and persistent across time, is because it is a response to the
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem">collective
action problem</a>. As long as humans form communities, we will need to
address the challenge of <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"

tangible (water, land, air) or intangible (expertise). Therefore,
learning how to be an effective bureaucrat improves your chances of
success.</p>
<p>The specific way a society is constructed (democratic, authoritarian,
dictatorship, anarchy) is irrelevant – bureaucracy is still present.
Even the libertarian approach of relying on contract enforcement implies
some amount of bureaucracy (e.g., forums for resolving contract disputes
like a court system).</p>
<p>Not all bureaucracy is due to the state, nor is bureaucracy confined
to companies. Parenting involves coming up with situation-specific

Dress codes for sports teams are arbitrary standards. Store clerks are
bureaucrats, as are website forum moderators. Content moderation is the
process of (inconsistently) enforcing arbitrary standards. This mindset
even permeates individuals as internalized expectations of policy and
enforcement when no one else is present.</p>
<p>Recognizing instances of bureaucracy enables more skillful
interaction, whether as a bureaucrat or as a subject. The rest of this

<h2 id="each-phase-of-life-involves-bureaucracy">Each Phase of Life
involves Bureaucracy</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR">TL;DR</a>: You have
experience with bureaucracy, though you may not have framed the
experiences as bureaucratic. Viewing relationships and roles through the
lens of bureaucracy explains the limitations of your expectations.</p>
<p> <br />
In each person’s life there are standard milestones: birth, education,
work, death. Each of these milestones and phases involves bureaucracy.
Each phase is a different experience of bureaucracy because the
bureaucratic roles change.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is composed of three roles: the policy creator, the
policy enforcer, and the subject (upon whom the policy is inflicted).
These roles can be confounded by oversubscribing the label “bureaucrat."
Who is the bureaucrat and who is the subject depends on the relationship
in a scenario.</p>
<p>For example, a store manager creates a policy, a store clerk enforces
the policy, and the policy is inflicted on the customer. Both the
manager and the store clerk would be bureaucrats, while the customer is
the subject. In a separate example, someone at corporate headquarters
sets a policy, the store manager enforces it, and the policy is
inflicted on the store clerk. Then the clerk was the subject of
bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-of-birth">Bureaucracy of
Birth<span id="sec:bureacracy-of-birth"
label="sec:bureacracy-of-birth"></span></h3>
<p>Your birth was marked by getting a name, registering with the state,
and initiating medical records. These tasks were administered by
bureaucrats (doctors and nurses and other hospital staff) on your
behalf, and you were the subject of the bureaucracy. You had no autonomy
or decision making authority.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-in-early-childhood">Bureaucracy
in Early Childhood<span id="sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood"
label="sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood"></span></h3>
<p>Before starting formal education, the bureaucracy of early childhood
is inflicted primarily by family members setting and carrying out
policies. The organization of bureaucrats is the family, with the shared
resources being housing, food, and expertise in surviving. Other
community members or caretakers may also be involved to carry out the
policies of taking care of you. Your decision making authority as a
subject in this bureaucracy was extremely limited.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucrats-at-school">Bureaucrats at
School<span id="sec:bureaucracy-of-school"
label="sec:bureaucracy-of-school"></span></h3>
<p>Once you started the formal education process, new bureaucrats got
involved. The community of bureaucrats could be a public school, a
private school, or homeschooling. In any of those cases, the frontline
bureaucrat is the teacher. You don’t have responsibility for making
policy that other people follow; you are still the subject of
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The expectations of each phase of school (high school, undergraduate,
graduate school) are distinct, and they are different from working in a
large organization. Your autonomy increases throughout the duration of
school. Your family and teachers are the bureaucrats. You start building
informal organizations of friends, and you start to explore policies
around social bonding.</p>
<p>Schooling sets a pattern that most students will fall into for the
rest of their lives: you were handed a textbook and told to solve a set
of problems. That pattern of taking direction can persist for a long
time. However, you are not constrained to that limitation. You have the
autonomy to do more than what is required. You can find other textbooks
that match your interests or are written from a different view.</p>
<p>You get to choose the book you want, even if you don’t get to choose
the topic you are going to be evaluated on. You don’t even need to pick
just one reference book – you can pick lots of books and figure out
which author style best fits you. You can also choose the level of
difficulty – basic and beginner level, or more advanced. You can choose
what’s best based on your understanding rather than defer to what a
class in school is supposed to cover.</p>
<p>As a subject of the education bureaucracy, you can discover how you
learn best. This extra effort requires self-reflection: How do you
learn? What works best? What didn’t work, and why not? What did you
learn? What do you wish you had learned?</p>
<p>Another pattern that schooling relies on is single choice decisions
where there is only one right answer. Examples include math problems and
multiple choice tests. Schooling tends to avoid setting up dilemmas or
paradoxes for students. Academic problems in the education process are
designed to be independent of the people involved or the history of the
situation.</p>
<p>In my schooling I learned how to approach technical issues and
develop solutions. That problem-solution paradigm neglects crucial steps
of discovering the problem, isolating the challenge, identifying
stakeholders, learning the history of the challenge, and negotiating
with stakeholders before trying to address the challenge.</p>
<p>My schooling led me to emphasize academics over socializing. When I
transitioned to professional work, I found social skills and political
savvy useful when trying to change organizations and policies.</p>
<p>Academic problems are intended to be solvable and answers submitted
get evaluated. In contrast, working in a bureaucratic organization the
challenges are ill-defined, there’s no known solution, and the topic is
sufficiently complex that you have to collaborate.</p>

Understanding the bureaucracy of healthcare is outside the scope of this

<p>Doctors and nurses and other staff are bureaucrats; you are the

<p> <br />
To illustrate bureaucracy of a large organization, consider the
importance of toilet paper at a hospital.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>If you go to a hospital, use the bathroom, and find there is no
toilet paper, that would indicate a deficiency of the hospital.</p>
<p>The <em>holistic view</em> is that someone didn’t refill the toilet
paper. Since the person who normally refills toilet paper wasn’t also a
user, they aren’t directly affected by the lack of toilet paper.</p>
<p>A routine is needed for checking availability of toilet paper in
bathrooms.</p>
<p>The <em>perspective of the purchasing manager</em> is that money
spent checking the status of toilet paper is money not spent on the
primary mission of the hospital: improving the health of community
members.</p>
<p>Minimizing checking of toilet paper is important for the reputation
of the organization, so a feedback mechanism is instituted: a phone
number is posted in the bathroom so users can send a text regarding
bathroom status at the hospital.</p>
<p>The <em>perspective of the janitor</em> is that my routine used to be
to go to each bathroom after normal business hours and refill toilet
papers. Now I have to do that and be on-call when someone alerts
management that service is needed. My responsibilities increased but my
pay did not.</p>
</div>
<p>Bureaucracy is a set of subjectively administered policies within an
organization. By recognizing the role of bureaucrats you are then able
identify what is negotiable.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-bureaucracy-dont-work">Alternatives to
Bureaucracy don’t work<span id="sec:alternatives-to-bureaucracy"
label="sec:alternatives-to-bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>A common refrain for participants in an organization is “Can’t I just
do the work?” with the implicit disinterest in coordination and
administrivia. In this section we’ll explore a few alternatives to
bureaucracy. These thought experiments illustrate the naive intent and
the practical deficiencies of each alternative.</p>
<p>The models of bureaucracy below are all imprecise because they are
analogies. The consequence of imprecision is wasted effort. Using a
precise and accurate definition of bureaucracy enables improved
effectiveness for the work you invest.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="efficient-bureaucracy">Efficient
Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>In an ideal scenario with no inefficiency, everyone comes to the same
conclusion when presented with the same information regarding management
of shared resources. Efficient bureaucracy requires each person to know
the skills of everyone else so that anyone can act as an expert in any
field.</p>
<p>In this scenario the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(business)">overhead
cost</a> of building consensus becomes unnecessary. There is no need to
fight over resources (e.g., money, staffing) and no need to fight over
what the direction of the organization should be. In this model of
efficient bureaucracy based on everyone having the same view, a
potential problem is the lack of diverse views needed to enable
resilient organizations.</p>
<p> <br />
While that idealized scenario is unrealistic, it points to how to
improve bureaucratic efficiency. Each bureaucrat should have access to
the same information (transparency). Each bureaucrat should apply the
same decision making process consistently (documented processes and
policies). Each bureaucrat should have the same incentives (fair
policies).</p>
<p>The unrealistic model of efficient bureaucracy also points to why
bureaucracy is inefficient in predictable ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not everyone has the same information.</p></li>
<li><p>Processes are applied inconsistently.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#sec:motivations">Incentives vary</a> among

<li><p>People prioritize putting out fires rather than attacking
critical issues.</p></li>
<li><p>People do not respond quickly (or at all) to communications
(e.g., email, phone, meetings). See the section on <a

<li><p>Bureaucrats and Subjects lie and employ other dark patterns (not
addressed in this book).</p></li>
<li><p>People make mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>Each person’s reference experiences are unique.</p></li>

<p>By identifying why bureaucracy is inefficient you can actively work
to remedy each of the above aspects.</p>
<p> <br />
Consider the following <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment">thought
experiment</a>. What if everybody in a bureaucracy had a different
opinion? How would consensus be arrived at? Can an organization operate
without having to form consensus for every decision?</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="perfect-bureaucracy">Perfect Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The definition of “perfect bureaucracy” depends on who is providing
the perspective. Here I illustrate both the view of the subject and the
view of the bureaucrat.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the subject of a bureaucratic organization,
perfect bureaucracy means many things: minimizing the time the subject
waits on a decision, getting perfectly correct decisions, decisions are
consistent across subjects and circumstances, decisions take into
account all relevant factors, and there is zero cost to the subject. Any
situation deviating from those expectations is a noticeable detriment to
the subject, leading to a negative reference experience of
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Never mind that the desires are unreasonable and conflicting. In a
real (i.e., imperfect) bureaucracy, subjects have a negative or neutral
experience. Positive interactions with bureaucracy are rare and are
regarded as anomalous.</p>
<p>Perfect bureaucracy for a bureaucrat means all information is
available, information is immediately available, and there is no moral
ambiguity (i.e., each answer is objective). Trade-offs become trivial
and the emotional toll of the work goes to zero. Then the bureaucrat is
able to serve subjects (an emotionally rewarding prospect).</p>
<p>This job in a perfect bureaucracy might feel hollow if all decisions
are obvious. In a real (imperfect) bureaucracy, the typical experience
is negative or neutral, punctuated by glimpses of satisfaction.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="everyone-do-their-own-thing-no-coordination-no-bureaucracy">Everyone
do their own thing – No Coordination, No Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The scenario involving minimal bureaucracy is a single person working
on a single task that does not last long (a few minutes), is relatively
easy (cognitively and physically and emotionally), and does not recur.
In that situation, building consensus is irrelevant and no process is
required. Even then, it is often the case that this simple task involves
the use of shared limited resources – basic essentials like water, air,
land. If your task involves use of those things, then how is fair use
determined among consumers?</p>
<p>For simplistic tasks the concept of community-imposed limits to
access of <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span> is not trivial.
When there are no policies to constrain access, independent allocation
of shared resources is determined by violence.</p>
<p>Most of your actions occur beyond the limits of simplicity and thus
incurs some concept of <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> (breaking a task into
subtasks). Staying with the one-person constraint, a complex task can
benefit from being broken into subtasks. Sometimes the order of the
subtasks matters, so we need to track the dependencies. A recurring
multi-step process with documentation is starting to have features of
bureaucracy, but lacks the need for consensus.</p>
<p>If one person lacks the skills relevant to a multi-step process, they
may engage another person to help. The interaction occurs on a spectrum
from informal (anarchy) to formalized in a contract (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">libertarian</a>). If
the parties working on the task fail to reach consensus, what is the
recourse? Choices include physical violence, threats, or involving a
third party (e.g., a court with lawyers and judges).</p>
<p>If a community wants to manage shared resources, how is that policy
decided? Building consensus is relevant, but what is the process for
establishing consensus? <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism">Nepotism</a> and cultural
norms and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religious
practices</a> served this role prior to the dominance of
bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="limit-bureaucracy-to-a-single-decider">Limit
Bureaucracy to a Single Decider<span id="sec:single-decider"
label="sec:single-decider"></span></h3>
<p>Since bureaucracy is distributed knowledge and distributed decision
making, it could be replaced by centralized knowledge and centralized
decision making. If we are going to live in a society and coordinate
shared resources, what if we had a single person deciding? How fast
could that be? Good decisions can’t be instantaneous – the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">OODA loop</a> is
necessary.</p>
<p>The input for the OODA model is to observe and the output is to act.
Observing and acting are measurable; the “orienting" and “deciding"
phases are not as easy to measure. The “orient" phase requires labeling
data received in the “observe" phase and connecting that information to
what is already known.</p>
<p>How quickly could a single decision maker apply the OODA loop for
arbitrary questions about <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span> accessed by a
community? Three minutes is not a lot of time to gather information and
share it to the relevant people, but let’s set that as a lower bound. If
a single decision takes three minutes, then in a ten hour work day
that’s a max of (10*60)/3 = 200 decisions per day. If this decider works
300 days out of the year, that gets us to 60,000 decisions per year.
While 60,000 decisions sounds like a lot, that limits how large the
community could feasibly be, and the complexity of the decisions are
limited.</p>
<p>Everyone has to talk to this decider directly since there’s no
bureaucracy to gather or disseminate the information. The diversity of
questions regarding shared resources would be challenging to answer
well.</p>
<p>Within the constraint of a single decider we can’t just automate
everything because carrying out the automation requires a staff to
implement. Automation isn’t free – it requires creation and maintenance.
Unless the same person making the decisions is also the person creating
and maintaining the system, there will be multiple people in an
organization.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy">Monarchies</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator">dictatorships</a> at
first glance seem to rely on a single decider. This is a simple model to
understand, but addressing all the edge cases for large society is
difficult. A single decider doesn’t scale for the number of decisions
needed, so the decider then appoints bureaucrats to subjectively enforce
policies.</p>
<p>From this thought experiment we conclude that avoiding bureaucracy by
relying on one person doesn’t scale. More people are needed to develop
and carry out policies.</p>
<p>If there’s more than one person in an organization, then
communication for coordination takes time. That’s the “orient” phase of
the OODA loop. Time spent orienting decreases the decision throughput of
the organization.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="avoid-bureaucracy-and-just-use-common-sense">Avoid Bureaucracy and
Just use Common Sense</h3>
<p><em>Claim</em>: Everything would go smoothly if each person used
common sense.</p>
<p>Common sense relies on reference experiences, cultural norms,
incentives, emotional state, and a lack of psychological defects. These
aspects are particular to each person in an organization. This gives
rise to the observation that “common sense is not so common."</p>
<p>There are multiple origins of what gets considered to be common
sense:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cultural norms. This is what I think everyone else does or
thinks.</p></li>
<li><p>Personal <span data-acronym-label="reference experience"

done it this way before.</p></li>
<li><p>A prescribed action seems obvious.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> <br />
Proponents of commonsense who work in existing hierarchical
bureaucracies may advocate removal of non-workers (i.e., management).
That may sound like a worker’s paradise, but then who coordinates the
activities when the number of people is above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>?</p>
<p> <br />
To illustrate the dissonance motivating common sense, consider the
following. Changing a burnt out light bulb at home takes me only a few
minutes. I’ve done that many times. Why is that task so hard in an
organization?</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>In a large organization comprised of specialized roles, an office
worker sees a bulb is out. Rather than go to a nearby hardware store and
buy a replacement, they notify their manager who notifies the building
supervisor who submits a request to the maintenance team.</p>
<p>The maintenance service desk team then schedules the repair. An order
of 1000 replacement bulbs was made last year and there are some still
available in storage. A maintenance team is assigned to the task and
deployed to replace the bulb.</p>
<p>First the maintenance team goes to the storage facility to get a
ladder and multiple bulbs of multiple models. The team has to sign out
the bulbs from storage so inventory can be tracked (because of prior
incidents of theft). A team is needed because solo use of the ladder is
prohibited (for safety, also born out of previous incidents). Multiple
bulb models are needed because which model is required is unspecified in
the service ticket. Having multiple bulbs available decreases the need
to go back to storage.</p>
<p>Once on site, the maintenance staff finds the bulb is a new type and
needs to be ordered. Maintenance team notifies the supervisor. A new
maintenance request is filed by the building manager.</p>
</div>
<p>This is the efficiency of specialization of roles. If you don’t like
it, you could go to the hardware store, buy a bulb, rent a ladder,
install the bulb, and return the ladder.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="completely-avoid-bureaucracy">Completely
Avoid Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The phrasing of avoidance is more precisely worded by replacing
“bureaucracy" with “coordination of stakeholders". If you avoid
coordination of stakeholders, you either are constrained to only work on
tasks that involve one person, or you get random (uncoordinated)
interactions.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="minimize-bureaucracy">Minimize
Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Again, try replacing “bureaucracy" with “coordination of
stakeholders." The goal of “minimizing coordination" probably isn’t the
real objective. To be more precise, a specific objective might be
“minimize time spent executing the task" (which takes a lot of
coordination prior to the task execution) or “minimize the level of
distraction to stakeholders" (chunk the coordination time, e.g. a
meeting). Another strategy for minimizing bureaucracy is to reduce the
number of stakeholders involved. For a given task complexity, this means
having smarter people who have more skills. See figure <a

Processes to Displace Bureaucracy<span id="sec:automation"

<p>The role of automation is to make interactions more predictable,
faster, and to handle more of them. Automation does not eliminate
bureaucracy; automation obfuscates the subjective decisions and limits
the ability to negotiate with decision makers.</p>
<p>There are benefits to automation, and automation can be enacted to
minimize harm to bureaucratic subjects. Automated systems can be made
more transparent by including documentation about what is happening,
why, and what’s next. This helps both bureaucrats and subjects identify
when assumptions made in the automation are incorrect.</p>
<p>There are indicators of when to transition a human-based bureaucratic
process to a more automated approach: <a href="#fn21"

<ul>

<p>There is an alternative to bureaucracy that features a decentralized

<p>An over-simplified definition<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> is “A market is a
medium that allows buyers and sellers of a specific good or service to
interact to facilitate an exchange." In practice, there is market
friction: “trading is always associated with certain costs or
restraints." <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The sources of friction in a market include</p>

<li><p>Uncertainty in hiring.</p></li>

<p>Complex tasks at a societal scale range from manufacturing advanced
computer chips, to creating and distributing critical medicine, to
immigration and border enforcement. If a society wants to carry out a
complex task involving multiple people, then coordination of effort is
required. The coordination can be explicit (in the form of a
bureaucracy) or implicit (via a market). Bureaucracy is one response to
the complexity of a problem being solved.</p>
<p> <br />
Regardless of whether a bureaucratic or market-based approach is used to
mediate access to <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span>, distributed
knowledge and distributed decision making are hindered by aspects like
limited bandwidth between people participating in the coordination,
non-zero latency of information between people, the cost of getting
data, and the cost of analysis of data. Due to these factors, decisions
that are suboptimal get made. See the discussion of <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a> on page  for specific examples
of trade-offs.</p>
<p> <br />
The objective and quantified concept of money creates accountability
that distinguishes commercial businesses from bureaucracy. Money as a
metric is common to all participants within the business and with
external stakeholders.</p>
<p>As with government bureaucrats, commercial businesses have employees
who make subjective decisions and enforce policies. Unlike government
bureaucracy, in business there is a common metric for feedback: money.
This distinction between business and government is not as clear as you
might expect since the feedback mechanism is not applicable to all
members of a business. Being an effective commercial bureaucrat may rely
on the success of other employees rather than a direct interaction with
customers. Business employees may take action that is hard to quantify
with respect to profits and losses.</p>
<p>Companies are motivated by financial profit, whereas bureaucracies
like prisons, schools, hospitals, governments, and militaries all
consume and spend money, but money isn’t the goal. When faced with a

instead of Bureaucracy</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy">Adhocracy</a> has
been proposed in reaction to the prevalence of bureaucracy in
organizations. To enact Adhocracy, suppose I have a team of diverse
experts assembled to tackle a complex challenge. While this may be
enough for short duration tasks, if the challenge lasts more than a day
or two there will be new issues beyond the original challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Who pays the salary for this labor?</p></li>
<li><p>Who calculates the payroll?</p></li>
<li><p>Who pays the rent for facilities used by the team?</p></li>
<li><p>Who does the maintenance on the facilities and equipment
used?</p></li>
<li><p>Who cleans the facility?</p></li>
<li><p>Does risk incurred mean insurance is needed?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To address these questions that are out-of-scope for the complex
challenge, you can either use a market-based approach or build a
bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="consensus-algorithms">Consensus
Algorithms</h3>
<p>In the description of a <a href="#sec:single-decider">single
decider</a> the solution was centralization of decision making and
knowledge. The decentralized approaches are market-based or
bureaucratic. Another approach to distributed decision making is to use
consensus algorithms like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(algorithm)">Raft</a><a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>. These algorithms are widely used
for a variety of computer-based tasks.</p>
<p>Implementing algorithms using humans is unreliable. Humans game the
system rather than operate within it. Also, relying on an algorithm
neglects the feature that humans are able to adapt to unforeseen
circumstances.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="elected-representatives">Elected
Representatives</h3>
<p>Governments are composed of politicians and bureaucrats. (Government
isn’t the only place bureaucrats appear, but for this section we’ll
focus on government.)</p>
<p>The concept of political representatives are easier to understand a
politician just one person acting in that behalf of other people.
Members of the community get a vote in who that representative is. In
contrast, the emergent behavior of bureaucracy is more difficult to
understand: many people are involved, and subjects of bureaucracy do not
appoint the bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Suppose that instead of a bureaucracy all members of an organization
charged with managing <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">shared resources</span> were elected
rather than being selected for their technical skills. This scenario
eliminates one of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy#Max_Weber">Weber’s
characteristics of bureaucracy</a> – competence for job
appointments.</p>
<p>In the United States there are bureaucratic positions that feature a
mix of election versus appointment. For example, the method of selecting
judges varies widely by state<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>. In a 2017 survey, 63%
of more than 1000 judges favored appointment over being elected. <a
href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Attorney Generals in the United States are similarly selected by
election and appointment <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. Positions that
benefit from expertise (e.g., Attorney Generals, Coroners) sometimes
lack minimum qualifications when selected by election. The more
positions there are to vote on, the more challenging it is to have an
informed electorate capable of selecting competing candidates.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="small-organizations">Small Organizations</h3>
<p>Suppose you try to limit bureaucracy by imposing the constraint that
teams or organizations be small.</p>
<p>Given three people in a team, options include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Split the labor among the participants; each has the same
workload and same tasks. Use consensus decision making. Do not exploit
skills unique to any member. (That last concept is an
inefficiency.)</p></li>
<li><p>Split the labor by specialization; each person becomes dependent
on the other. Specialization enabled can improve effectiveness but also
incurs coordination which decreases throughput.</p></li>
<li><p>Make one person the manager to oversee the other two – impose a
hierarchy. This is a specific form of specialization where one person is
not directly involved in the labor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Organizing members into teams (recursively, teams comprised of teams)
introduces new levels of coordination and competition.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="minimize-bureaucracy-by-eliminating-guardrails">Minimize Bureaucracy
by Eliminating Guardrails</h3>
<p>Suppose that you are part of an organization that doesn’t have
oversight processes for finances and other resources your organization
is responsible for. A small percentage of the population, say 1%, will
take advantage of the lack oversight for their own gain. Those malicious
actors can be either subjects of bureaucracy or bureaucrats within the
organization. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier">Bruce Schneier</a>
calls these people defectors <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012_Schneier">(Schneier 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, suppose a small percentage of the population, say 1%, is
stupid and makes mistakes. Without a review process, these mistakes will
negatively impact your organization’s finances and the resources your
organization manages. Preventing, detecting, and correcting mistakes can
be costly investments.</p>
<p> <br />
If you think bureaucracy sucks and it should be removed or replaced,
then consider the parable of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton&#39;s_fence">Chesterton’s
fence</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There exists ... a fence or gate erected across a road. The more
modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the
use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type
of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I
certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you
can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you
to destroy it.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"

</blockquote>
<p>You need to understand the historical progression of each process
that your organization relies on so that you understand why bureaucracy
exists.</p>
<h2 id="bureaucrats-view-of-their-organization">Bureaucrat’s View of
their Organization<span id="sec:alternative-views-from-within"
label="sec:alternative-views-from-within"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy <a href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">as I have defined
it</a> is not the only way that bureaucrats perceive their environment.
To understand their situation, bureaucrats typically consider
themselves, their work, their subjects, their coworkers, their
superiors, and their subordinates. Complicating this approach, the <a
href="#sec:motivations">motives of an individual bureaucrat</a> for an
activity varies. The variance of motivations is even more complicated
when a request incurs more work and there’s no deadline and there’s no
reward. What is your incentive? Is it emotional approval? Relationship
building? Social approval?</p>
<p>Most bureaucrats don’t self-identify as bureaucrats even if they do
recognize they operate in a bureaucratic organization. The common
paradigm is, “I’m an engineer and the company I work for is
bureaucratic" or “I’m manager and my team is distracted by too much
administrativia" or “Paul must not like me, he doesn’t respond to my
messages."</p>
<p>As a consequence of not thinking about the bureaucratic system you
operate within, a common response is to develop heuristics that fit the
recurring patterns you’ve experienced. Unlike relying on an explanatory
theory, heuristics evolve as you encounter novel situations. While that
feels like learning, the heuristics you develop are specific to your
motives and your experiences.</p>
<p> <br />
The perspectives below are archetypal for bureaucrats who don’t consider
bureaucracy <a href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">as defined</a> in this
book. In practice, a practitioner’s perspective might be a mixture of
these views.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is what I can do with my skills
and the resources I have access to.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: This person is task oriented. Results are what
matters. The intricacies of bureaucracy are a distraction to getting the
work done. Communication for coordination is a distraction from work
being done by the individual. This bureaucrat may have the perception
that if they participate in community then they will be blamed when
things go wrong. The emotional reward for this person is doing or
completing the task. This person is likely to say to their manager,
“Tell me what I need to do to be successful" rather than identify
collaborations.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is how I feel.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your feelings are real. They have consequence, in
that your emotions affect motivation and enthusiasm. However, a
feelings-centric perspective may not be productive for you or your team
or the organization. Brainstorming can feel unpredictable. Challenging
statements made by coworkers may feel intimidating. Talking about tough
topics is emotionally difficult. Being effective means compromise and
some people may not get everything they wanted.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>What matters is how others feel.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Depending on the emotional state of those around
you is unhealthy and can be unproductive. Working for the happiness or
satisfaction of other people is risky – they may not know what’s best,
or they may not have your interests in mind.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>What matters are my immediate coworkers.</strong><br />
This perspective can be positive (e.g., I collaborate with those around
me) or negative (e.g., I am in competition with those around me). In
this scenario everything beyond the local scope is personified or
ignored.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your relationships do matter. However, they are not
all that matters. Missing from this view is the ability to explain what
is happening outside the immediately observable realm.</p>
<p> <br />
Just because you are a bureaucrat doesn’t mean you have a well-informed
understanding of bureaucracy. Regardless of which above perspective is
held, a bureaucrat certainly experiences the difficulties of operating
within an organization. A bureaucrat can rationalize to themselves why
things don’t work in their organization with stories like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Other people are lazy and don’t want to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Other people are inexperienced.</p></li>
<li><p>Other people don’t care.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There certainly are lazy people, inexperienced people, and people who
don’t care in any given organization. Those are not unique to
bureaucracy and do not explain bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The bureaucrat who uses the explanations like laziness, lack of
experience, and lack of care applies them to people he or she hasn’t
directly interacted with. The bureaucrat using these explanations may
not realize other people could apply those same stories to the
bureaucrat.</p>
<h2 id="models-of-bureaucracy-that-are-incomplete">Models of Bureaucracy
that are Incomplete<span id="sec:models-of-bureaucracy"
label="sec:models-of-bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>Coming up with a holistic theory of bureaucracy is desirable but
difficult. Bureaucracy exists in every society, so having an explanatory
theory would help identify what aspects are essential and what is
accidental. Having a theory of bureaucracy could help identify what
should be improved and what should be discarded. An expectation for the
existence of a theory stems from the repeated independent creation of
bureaucracy in diverse societies in different time periods.</p>
<p>Characterizing bureaucracy is difficult because organizations
comprised of unique humans are aware of attempts to be characterized and
respond to stories told about bureaucracy; see the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne
effect</a>. As soon as a claim about aspects that characterize
bureaucracy is made, then an individual can respond to that claim by
behaving in an opposing manner. Worse still for the theory, bureaucrats
can coordinate amongst themselves to provide counterexamples.</p>
<p>In the following section I outline a few conventional ways of
modeling bureaucracy to point out the shortcomings of each model. The
relevance to the practicing bureaucrat of familiarity with these models
is so that you know the boundaries of each model. Awareness of the
limitations of each model enables you to know when the model is an
applicable story and when the model is not explanatory.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-as-a-machine">Bureaucracy as a
Machine</h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: Bureaucracy is a machine that has throughput and
latency and dependencies and mechanisms. Bureaucrats are cogs in that
machine.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: Bureaucracy can be complicated and
feel mechanical with standardization, top-down dictates, and
interlocking processes. There is a risk of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation">deindividuation</a>
for bureaucrats.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: Perceiving yourself as a cog in the
machine implies a loss of agency. This is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy">self-fulfilling
prophecy</a> – if you think you don’t have agency, then you may stop
acting as though you have agency.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-as-an-economic-model">Bureaucracy
as an Economic model</h3>
<p><em>Narrative 1</em>: Bureaucracy is a collection of individual
rational actors.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: Individual bureaucrats cooperate or
compete to promote their own self-interests. The culture of an
organization is a result of individual self-interests of each
bureaucrat. Individuals make decisions that promote their own
self-interests.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: This view is hard to distinguish
from a marketplace.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Narrative 2</em>: Bureaucracy is comprised of competing
special-interest groups.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: The observation of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice">Public Choice
theory</a> is that a concentrated minority that stands to gain a
disproportionate benefit will act in their own self-interest.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: In a generic bureaucratic
organization it is not clear which team would be more concentrated than
any other team, nor is it clear what the disproportionate benefit might
be. There is a concentrated minority at the top of any hierarchy, and
the top of the hierarchy does act in their own self-interest, though
this is not particular to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations may have specific teams with access to
disproportionate benefits, but this book focuses on generic bureaucratic
features. Effective bureaucrats are all alike; every bureaucrat is
ineffective in their own way <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Narrative 3</em>: A Bureaucracy is a subcategory of a Firm.<br />
Firms exist in a market because negotiating contracts and prices for
every interaction is burdensome. A bureaucracy could be considered as a
type of firm that specializes at the organizational level in policy
administration or resource management.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: This is correct.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="bureaucracy-as-emergent-phenomenon">Bureaucracy as Emergent
phenomenon</h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: There is a universality to bureaucracy in both
the diversity of scenarios and persistence across time that hints at <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a>. <em>Why
this model feels true</em>: Bureaucracy as a macroscopic phenomenon is
emergent when there are a sufficient number of people involved. The size
of the organization is important because there is no longer dependence
on individual relationships (i.e., a size above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>). There are people in the organization that you don’t know
and therefore there is a lack of personal accountability. An
organization is subdivided into teams recursively until there is local
person-to-person accountability. The underlying behaviors that enable
emergence are bilateral interactions among humans and a lack of feedback
mechanisms.</p>
<p>At the scale of individual bureaucrats, every person is playing by
different rules and has different goals and everything is changing –
both the individuals and the conditions. Above the threshold for
emergence of bureaucracy there is scale-free behavior. The same patterns
are observable at large organizations and extremely large organizations.
A bureaucrat in one organization recognizes patterns of professional
life experienced by bureaucrats at another organization. The local
mechanisms bureaucrats employ to enable distributed decisions using
distributed knowledge include meetings, processes, and communications.
While local nuances differ, a generic pattern is apparent.</p>
<p>The choices faced by an individual bureaucrat are interdependent with
the choices made by other bureaucrats in their environment. There is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)">flocking
behavior</a> where my choices are informed by the choices of those
around me. Unlike flocking of birds, the adjacency metric for
bureaucrats is not necessarily spatial distance. Instead, visibility of
the decisions and consequences inform adjacency.</p>
<p>The relevance of claiming bureaucracy is emergent is that there is
behavior occurring at the macroscopic scale. Knowing motives and actions
of every individual bureaucrat at the microscopic level is not relevant.
Treating organizations as complex and adaptive systems gives insight on
how to work within the dynamic environment <span class="citation"
data-cites="2011_Eisenhardt">(Eisenhardt and Piezunka 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>A colloquial interpretation of emergent behavior from complex
phenomena is treating the system as an entity – personification. When an
organization is assigned behaviors <span class="citation"
data-cites="2002_Gall">(Gall 2002)</span>, it is useful to remember that
the organization is comprised of individual bureaucrats.</p>
<p>More formally, there are distinct categories of emergence <span
class="citation" data-cites="2002_Bedau 2021_Carroll_168">(Bedau 2002;
Mindscape 2021b)</span>. Nominal emergence names the phenomena of a
thing being distinct from its constituents: a circle is emergent from a
collection of points; a pile of sand emerges from grains of sand. Merely
putting many bureaucrats in a room is insufficient to create
bureaucracy; there’s more to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Weak emergence occurs when there are phenomena that are independent
of the underlying interactions. For example, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)">gliders</a>
in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s
Game of Life</a>. Weak emergence is measurable using <a

causality</a> or, equivalently<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_entropy">transfer
entropy</a> (information theory). I don’t know how to apply these
measures to bureaucratic organizations.</p>
<p><em>What this model is missing</em>: The problem with treating an
organization as an entity is that apparent behavior is
counter-intuitive <span class="citation" data-cites="2002_Gall">(Gall
2002)</span>. Breaking the organization into individual people with
motives helps clarify causes of observed behavior.</p>
<p>In practice, bureaucracy is worse than emergent because the rules can
be altered or ignored by stakeholders. Bureaucracy is a <a

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-in-game-theory">Bureaucracy in
Game Theory</h3>
<p><em>Narrative 1</em>: Bureaucracy can be understood as one or more
games played by bureaucrats.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>:<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: Bureaucracy defined as distributed
knowledge and distributed decision making does not fit cleanly into the
game theory categories of being either cooperative or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperative_game_theory">competitive</a>
– in practice there are elements of both.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Narrative 2</em>: Another frame for interactions within a
bureaucracy is to consider a variety of games. This view is similar to
market conditions. Which game is applicable depends on the specifics of
the situation.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>:<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: Bureaucracy is in constant flux due
to external conditions, externally imposed constraints, staff turn-over,
internal dilemmas, and disagreements among individuals.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="bureaucracy-as-evolutionary-outcome">Bureaucracy as Evolutionary
Outcome</h3>
<p><em>Narrative 1</em>: Biological, Genetic evolution – Individual
level.<br />
There might be biological arguments for a genetic basis for bureaucracy.
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: For example, Zebra fish and Hyenas
have a gene for dominance<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: “Genes code for proteins, so there
are no ‘genes for’ phenotypes per se, including behavioral phenotypes."
<span class="citation" data-cites="2015_Lilienfeld">(Lilienfeld et al.
2015)</span></p>
<p>Non-human animals make subjective decisions and do not get labeled as
bureaucrats. Human make decisions that are not explained by reproductive
fitness.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Narrative 2</em>: Biological, Genetic evolution – Group
selection.<br />
<em>Why this model feels true</em>: <a
href="#sec:hierarchy-of-roles">Hierarchy</a> is not unique to humans.
Primates form into social hierarchies based on dominance over a shared
resources like mates and food.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: a gene for bureaucracy. A genetic
model does not explain what behaviors an individual bureaucrat can take
to be more effective.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Narrative 3</em>: <a

as method for coordination is a better idea than <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism">nepotism</a> or

nepotism and religion, and bureaucracy occurs within religion.</p>

id="bureaucracy-as-product-focused-narrative">Bureaucracy as
Product-focused Narrative</h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: Ignore the bureaucrats and instead focus on how a
product progresses through a process.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Ignoring bureaucrats involved in processes
simplifies the narrative (the product is the main character).
<em>Example</em>: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgVKvqTItto">School House Rock:
I’m Just A Bill</a><br />

<p><em>Narrative</em>: Ignore the bureaucrats and instead focus on the

<em>Why this feels true</em>: The person experiencing bureaucracy as a
subject is confused by “why isn’t this easier?”<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: History of why the process exists
and how it evolved (i.e., legacy), protection against malicious
subjects, and protection against malicious bureaucrats.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="bureaucracy-as-psychological-phenomenon">Bureaucracy as
Psychological Phenomenon</h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: Bureaucracy as a pure power struggle. Or the
interplay of individual pathologies.</p>
<p>Organizations are composed of individuals with personalities, and
inefficiency is attributable to a mashing together of distinct
individuals with conflicting desires. While this is true, it isn’t
complete.<br />
<em>What this model is missing</em>: Personality-focused narrative
neglects the history of processes (legacy), protection against malicious
subjects, and protection against malicious bureaucrats. Analysis that
stops at personalities misses emergent phenomena.</p>
<p> <br />
Each of the above models of bureaucracy has shortcomings. Knowing why
each model is not a complete description helps you avoid the trap of
thinking only in terms of a single model.</p>
<p>The rest of this book ignores these partial characterizations of
bureaucracy. Rather than take the external (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emic_and_etic">emic</a>) view of
bureaucracy, this book takes the internal (etic) perspective of a
bureaucrat operating within an organization. The description of
bureaucracy in this book is used to contextualize advice for how to be
an effective bureaucrat.</p>
<h2 id="not-many-options-for-organizations">Not many Options for
Organizations</h2>
<p>When complaining about the ineptitude of organizations (or more
specifically, leaders, managers, subordinates, and coworkers), consider
the variables available to be modified. As a thought exercise, what
would it take to rebuild the organization you are in from scratch?</p>
<p>Listing the levers available for enacting change to an organization
is intended to emphasize the importance of personal interactions within
bureaucracy. When you get frustrated with apparent inefficiency,
consider the systemic changes available – there aren’t that many.
Options for the organization are limited, so the importance of your
creativity and informal influence is dominant in determining the
effectiveness of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Organizations comprised of bureaucrats have fewer options for change
than individual bureaucrats. The choices an individual bureaucrat faces
are described in the section on <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a> (page ). In comparison, the
choices faced by the designers of an organization are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Flatness of organizational hierarchy – how many layers of
oversight are there? Another way of arriving at the same structure is to
ask how many employees are there per supervisor.</p></li>
<li><p>Hierarchy split by function (all the lawyers in one team, all the
engineers in one team, all the sale people in one team) or by product
(mixing experts to solve a customer’s problem)?</p></li>
<li><p>Size of organization. More people allows more specialization and
requires more support.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizations are segmented into teams, and there are not many
options for segmentation: create a new team, merge existing teams,
dissolve a team.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizations create processes for recurring tasks like hiring,
promotion (pay or title), awards, compensation, recognition,
professional training, and firing. Each of those have a set of design
choices that inform the organization’s culture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a government bureaucracy, the constraints of some incentives like
pay and financial awards are set outside the organization. That further
constrains the ability of bureaucrats to shape their organization’s
culture.</p>
<p>The organization may have policies and processes regarding hiring,
promotion, training, and firing, but the decision may be made by team
managers rather than top-level management.</p>
<p>Enumerating choices an organization faces is only relevant in the
context of a desire to change. Individual bureaucrats can enact change,
and subjects of bureaucracy can request improvement, but those are weak
inputs. Organizations are accountable to their source of funding, not
the subjects of bureaucracy or members of the organization. For example,
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service">Internal
Revenue Service (IRS)</a> is accountable to Congress, not the tax payer
or IRS employees.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="not-many-options-for-teams">Not many options
for Teams</h3>
<p>Similar to the limited number of options available for shaping
organizations, the structural choices faced by a team are constrained.
The relevance of listing what can be done is to again emphasize the
importance of personal relationships for effective bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Team managers might decide who gets hired and who gets promoted and
who goes to what training and who gets fired. Though in some
environments even that control is relegated to an external team. A team
manager usually has decision making authority regarding tasks the team
works on.</p>
<p>Accountability in the context of teams comes from person-to-person
interactions. These can be either lateral (sideways) or parent-child
(top-down) or child-parent (bottom-up) <span class="citation"
data-cites="2014_Jorgensen">(Jorgensen, Bruehl, and Franke 2014)</span>.
Each of these three categories have associated constraints.</p>
<p>The upward child-parent (bottom-up) communication is either
inadequate (too few updates, or not enough information, or insufficient
context), relevant, or excessive. For example, a weekly or monthly
report to multiple superiors may be inadequate.</p>
<p>Finding the balance depends on the presenter knowing the individual
audience members so that a tailored message is provided, and then
adapting to the specifics of the situation.</p>
<p>The downward parent-child communication either is inadequate (no
direction provided or imprecise direction provided), provides actionable
vision, or micromanagement. Finding the right balance and specificity
requires insight into the communication needs on both sides of the
relationship.</p>
<p>For lateral interactions among team members, the tension between
cooperation and competition manifest in struggles over money, staffing,
products (output), and resources (inputs). Here “resources” refers to
constraints like access to data, control of data, technology resources,
hardware, floor space, and expertise.</p>

this minimum is tricky since optimization can be with respect to
resilience to change, resilience to edge cases, staff turn-over, speed
experienced by consumer, financial cost, time spent by the organization,
and number of staff. Miss any one of those goals and the bureaucracy is
deemed inefficient.</p>
<p>Undesirable bureaucracy is categorized as either accidental or
legacy. Accidental bureaucracy arises when someone misunderstands what
is needed, or when skills of the bureaucrats involved are insufficient
for the complexity a problem. Legacy bureaucracy occurs when the
situation changes but the processes do not.</p>
<p>Accidental and legacy bureaucracy accumulate within an organization.
Optimization of improved efficiency is at odds with change which
disrupts careers, relationships, and accumulated power.</p>
<p>Resolving each of these suboptimal conditions may seem easy: have
better knowledge of the problem, assign the right people to the problem,
and change processes as problems evolve. In practice the easy resolution
is challenging.</p>
<p>Having enough knowledge is often infeasible, especially for complex
problems at large scale. Having the people with the right skills assumes
that a pipeline of people with relevant talents exists and that people
in the pipeline won’t be poached to work on other challenges. Keeping up
with evolving problems depends on having resources to change (beyond the
maintenance baseline), and having a defined approach for changing the
process.</p>

<p>Discussions about bureaucracy by non-experts often rely on common
conceptions that are <span data-acronym-label="thought terminating"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">thought terminating</span>.
Identifying these enables you to understand both why the fallacy is
attractive during a discussion with fellow bureaucrats and how each idea
is incomplete.</p>
<p>These fallacies may at first feel right but are in fact misleading.
In contrast there are <a href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">unavoidable
hazards</a> (see page ) which may feel bad but reveal underlying
truths.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is
bad</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: When a person subjected to bureaucracy has
a negative experience, the easiest attribution is to the
least-understood aspect – the bureaucracy.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> as defined is
neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is merely a way of managing resources
shared amongst a community.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>There is no point in planning
ahead since everything (staffing, funding, purpose, scope) is always
changing.</strong><br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Change can feel disorienting, especially
when it is unexpected. A change of the assumptions for a plan may make
the plan less relevant.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Preparing for change and thinking ahead
about contingencies enables effective use of resources. Have a vision
and work towards it while accounting for and adapting to change. This
approach requires extra work, some of which will be left unused. See
Dilemma <a href="#table:emergencies-vs-ignore" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:emergencies-vs-ignore">4.11</a> on page .</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is an aberration, a
mistake, due to poor planning or incompetent
participants</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Mistakes are made, poor or insufficient
planning does happen, and some participants are incompetent.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Bureaucracy occurs even if no mistakes
are made, effort is spent on effective planning, and participants are
competent. That’s because, in the use of distributed knowledge and
distributed decision making, bureaucrats face <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a>.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is
inefficient</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Expressed by both subjects and bureaucrats
who observe seemingly wasteful processes.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: If bureaucracy were truly inefficient
(not allocating resources in the most efficient way), then in a
competitive environment it would be replaced by a more efficient
approach. The key is to ask, “efficient with respect to what metric?”
The metric of money, or time, or number of people, or stability, or
robustness to perturbation? Second, what would motivate improved
efficiency? Without incentives, change is less likely.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is due to
malfeasance.</strong><br />
The specific number of malicious bureaucrats in variations on this
fallacy ranges from “all of the participants” to “just enough to be
problematic.”<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: There are bad actors present in any system
comprised of humans.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Most participants are earnestly trying to
help make a positive contribution, even though that can be hard to see
from the view of subjects or even other bureaucrats. Processes like
isolation or promotion exist within bureaucracy to deal with malicious
bureaucrats.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is a sign of decay
from within the organization.</strong><br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Relationships within an organization have
a half-life and require on-going investment to renew. At the same time,
new bureaucratic processes are constantly being developed by other
bureaucrats. The number of processes increase as the organization ages.
Bureaucracy seems to arise without effort and countering it takes
effort.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Bureaucracy unavoidably emerges in every
organization because coordination is required. The negative connotation
of decay should be replaced with a sense of neutral evolution.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>If the response to a request I
make can’t be expedited, my request must not be
important</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Other people would demonstrate they care
about what I am working on by prioritizing things I am dependent
on.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: When everything gets prioritized, that’s
the same as nothing getting priority.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>The expected duration of a task
is how long it would take one person to accomplish</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: When I imagine carrying out a task, the
default is a story with one character.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: This narrative fails to account for the
overhead of interaction among participants and delays due to
asynchronous dependencies. <span class="citation"
data-cites="1975_brooks">(Brooks 1975)</span></p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>When developing or altering
policy, focus on the average or majority (to the exclusion of
outliers)</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this simplification is misleading</em>: Sometimes outliers are
not just more of the same; they alter the outcome. During the transition
from horses-for-transportation to cars, cars could initially have been
considered outliers.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>People learn from their
mistakes</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: There’s an optimistic desire for this to
be true.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: People repeat mistakes without noticing.
People do not naturally reflect on their failings in a constructive way
and then apply insights to future situations. People <em>can</em> learn
from their mistakes. Doing so requires a low latency feedback loop and
incentive to change. In bureaucracies feedback loops are weak so
learning may not happen.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>Processes are
serial</strong>.<br />
A conventional approach to process design is a sequence of tasks. As an
example, consider approval chains.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Serial processes are easier to
understand.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Some tasks that are independent can be
carried out concurrently; see the section on <a
href="#sec:reducing-overhead">reducing overhead</a> on page .</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>Hard work creates
results</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Some results do require hard work. The
alternative (results arise serendipitously, or with little effort) is
not inspiring.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Hard work can be invested on wasteful
effort. Don’t confuse being busy with being productive. Sometimes
insight is more useful than hard work.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>You cannot pay a little and get a
lot</strong>; see the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law_of_business_balance">Common
law of business balance</a>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: If small investments made a big difference
we’d already be making the investment.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: This doesn’t account for creative
solutions and ignores <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudge theory</a> from
behavioral economics.</p>
<p> <br />
When you are reasoning about bureaucratic systems, there may be a
conclusion that is concise and feels explanatory. Then you should try to
come up with counter examples, either logically or from experience.</p>
<p>Some fallacies are based on an expectation that other people should
to be more like what you imagine best self to be. That mindset fails to
account for your own shortcomings and the diversity of other
bureaucrats.</p>

Administrative Overhead<span id="sec:reducing-overhead"

<p>You can read this list from a position of authority to take action,
or you can read this list as an advocate for improvement.</p>
<p>In isolation, none of these ideas should be surprising. Enacting each
idea requires ongoing investment. A champion is needed to actively
promote and support each idea.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Automate recurring decision processes. Automation
can decrease work and decrease the risk of inconsistent outcomes.
Automation is a way of encoding bureaucratic processes that involve
subjective decisions into repeatable steps.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Bureaucrats don’t know how to
automate processes, or there isn’t infrastructure available to support
automation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Where automation is infeasible for a process
involving multiple bureaucrats, make advocates with end-to-end authority
available to the subject. This improves the subject’s experience of a
process. A benefit to the organization is that the advocate might see
opportunities for improvement not apparent to a bureaucrat responsible
for one step in the process.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: The organization may lack
incentives to provide customer advocates. When there is a customer
advocate, that person may not have the skills or time to exert
end-to-end oversight of the process.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make processes transparent to participants. This
improves the subject’s understanding of a process. Transparency can help
with trustworthiness if the reasoning for actions is defensible.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Transparency requires technology
not central to the process. Transparency costs money that could
otherwise be spent on more central tasks in the organization.
Transparency can provide data that is then used against the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make information discoverable (e.g., via search
engine).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Technology that isn’t the core
strength of the organization is a distraction from the central work and
a cost (in terms of staff and money).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make information directly available, rather than
mediated by a person.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Having to talk to a person
re-inforces the importance of that person. The data owner feels needed,
and that can be emotionally rewarding. Whereas providing an API is less
personal.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: After an interaction is completed, summarize the
steps and outcome for the participant.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Writing notes takes time away from
accomplishing work. The written notes may not adequately capture
nuances</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: When a process fails the needs of a participant,
investigate the failure and improve the process<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: A way to detect failures is needed.
Why would that exist? A goal of improvement sounds good, but what
incentive does the bureaucrat have to drive improvement?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make the goals and priorities of the organization
clear to all stakeholders. This enables accountability by allowing a
participant to point to dissonance.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Sharing goals enables
accountability.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Define measurable standards of performance, both
for individual bureaucrats and for teams. Again, accountability is a
feedback loop that needs a starting point for identifying
dissonance.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>:</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Train bureaucrats how to engage participants
effectively; these interactions determine the culture of an
organization.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: If training is pursued at all,
justifying domain-specific technical training is easier.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Train bureaucrats by addressing their immediate
problems (e.g., through mentorship).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Mentorship doesn’t result in
promotion. The attention of experienced mentors is a zero-sum investment
that takes away from time spent doing measurable work.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make employment desirable to people who have
desirable characteristics (e.g., educated candidates).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Hiring less expensive candidates is
easier to justify.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Enhance accountability to peers (e.g., peer review
of actions and outcomes).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Accountability is relevant if
improvement is desired and if you think your peers are in a position to
provide useful feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Look for ways to encourage organizations and
individual bureaucrats to improve and take risks rather than maintain
the status quo.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Deviating from the status quo means
taking risk. Specifically risk to incumbent power.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Decision making should be pushed down the hierarchy
to the practitioner <span class="citation"
data-cites="2013_Marquet">(Marquet 2013)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Power comes from decision making.
Pushing decision down means letting go of power.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: When decision making requires cross-organization
interaction, form a team of practitioners.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Relying on practitioners to
coordinate takes management out of the critical path.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Supervisors should share workload with their team
to gain practical exposure to current challenges.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: The skills a supervisor has may not
intersect with work being done by team members.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Seek feedback from process participants; then
provide status updates on the implementation of changes. This provides a
feedback loop and is a form of accountability.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Gathering feedback is an
opportunity cost for getting work done. If <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process">continual
improvement</a> isn’t a basis for promotion of bureaucrats, there’s no
little motive to invest effort.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Replace sequential approval chains with a
concurrent review process. Sequential approval reduces the number of
ideas reaching later approvers by filtering good ideas as well as bad
ideas. Approvers may perform independent (redundant) due diligence and
end up disagreeing.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn’t happen</em>: Concurrent approval has the risk of
unnecessary work (someone says yes after someone else says no or asks
for additional justification) and likely conflict when two reviewers
disagree.</p></li>

Effective Bureaucrat</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy is a system of distributed knowledge and distributed
decision making, so coordination is critical.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You communicate more effectively than anyone around you. This
applies to verbal and written communication, formal presentations and
informal interactions.</p></li>
<li><p>You facilitate meetings so that productivity is noticeably
improved. This means creating and sharing an agenda, providing rules on
interaction (e.g., raising hands), taking notes, sharing notes, and
following on with assigned tasks after the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>You take part in meetings, whether that means actively
contributing or intentionally supporting other attendees. You leverage
relationships with other attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>You invest effort in written communication (emails, text-based
chats, reports). Your writing empathizes with readers, captures relevant
context, is concise, and is clearly worded.</p></li>
<li><p>You communicate verbally concisely and precisely. You listen and
you teach. You seek shared definitions. You are <a
href="#sec:professional-vulnerablity">professionally
vulnerable</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are in-person with colleagues, you walk around and talk
with people one-on-one.</p></li>
<li><p>In your role as bureaucrat you leverage project management
skills: you have a vision, you make and share plans, all while building
consensus with stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>You apply your negotiation skills <span class="citation"
data-cites="1982_Cohen">(Cohen 1982)</span> that improve your
interactions and outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>You reply quickly to incoming requests, whether that means
answering directly or acknowledging the request and providing a timeline
for when you will answer. This allows other people’s tasks to either be
resolved or have a clear response about when progress can be
expected.</p></li>
<li><p>You strive for and demonstrate transparency. You share
information with stakeholders. The reason transparency matters is
because it enables coordination without your explicit action.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The superpowers of a bureaucrat that facilitate cooperation and
progress in any organization include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You seek information from stakeholders without burdening them.
When your requests are burdensome, you acknowledge that and seek ways to
pay back (or forward) their investment.</p></li>
<li><p>You apply consistent processes (rather than being reactionary and
applying ad hoc responses).</p></li>
<li><p>You hold others (and yourself) accountable for their actions.
Accountability is created by clearly stating objectives and then
measuring results.</p></li>
<li><p>You adapt to the varying incentives and reference experiences of
those around you. Flexibility enables interactions with diverse
coworkers.</p></li>
<li><p>Your effectively multi-task, or, more accurately, switch tasks.
The switch among tasks is triggered when the current task encounters an
externally-generated pause. You can <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)#Concept_and_motivation">pipeline
your activities</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You are prepared with a backlog of ideas (in writing) if someone
shows up with resources.</p></li>
<li><p>You know when to change communication channels (from text chats
to phone calls to in-person).</p></li>
<li><p>If you are dependent on someone else getting something done to
enable your progress, you can demonstrate priority by physically show up
– <u>presence creates priority</u>. Being physically at a person’s desk
motivates that person to respond better than calling them or emailing
them. Showing up where someone works and talking with them conveys how
much priority you place on the actions of the person you’re talking
with.</p></li>
<li><p>You have intellectual empathy – theory of mind for thinking
(whereas empathy refers to emotions). How to grow your intellectual
empathy: shadow peers and bosses and coworkers and
subordinates.</p></li>
<li><p>You have <span data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span>. You recognize
the deviations and exceptions that cause processes to come into
existence.</p></li>
<li><p>You avoid unintentionally neglecting tasks or requests. This
requires capturing incoming requests and then providing a response about
prioritization and status. This matters because other participants in
the organization should regard you as reliable in a positive
sense.</p></li>
<li><p>You focus on value delivery in relationships to a degree that
exceeds the scope of your formal role.</p></li>
<li><p>You have altered your job description to fit the growth you’re
seeking.</p></li>
<li><p>You are willing to engage on a personal level and know
stakeholders outside their professional role.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of your tasks have a customer, a deadline, and a deliverable
artifact. You iterate towards a result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You occasionally ponder and discuss with other people introspective
questions like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How can I be successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the ways I could fail?</p></li>
<li><p>How would the organization be characterized as

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="frames-used-by-effective-bureaucrats">Frames
used by Effective Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>Being an effective bureaucrat is a mindset. I refer to these
perspectives as framing.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Framing</em>: A bureaucrat can accomplish more as part of an
organization than by working alone. Being a member of an organization
means the bureaucrat’s identity is subsumed into service for the
organization they are part of <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>. At the same time,
bureaucracy enables the bureaucrat to amplify their presence by being
part of a larger organization. Sometimes the cost of being part of the
organization exceeds the force multiplier of working together.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Framing</em>: Measuring your own personal growth in a bureaucracy is
difficult due to the lack of <a
href="#sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples">feedback loops</a>. One approach
is to measure your capabilities with respect to a specific task. If you
can complete the task in less time and with fewer resources and with
less effort, that’s progress. If you can now complete a task that you
previously wanted to but weren’t able to, that’s progress.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Feelings</em>: Bureaucracy induces an emotional response in
participants because things don’t work they way each person wants. This
can lead emotionally to frustration and then apathy. Understanding how
things work in a bureaucracy can help decrease the anger.</p>
<p>Another emotional response to bureaucracy is a sense of
powerlessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some third person decides your fate: this is the whole essence of
bureaucracy.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sense of powerlessness applies both to bureaucrats and to
subjects of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The sense of powerlessness is somewhat valid, in that you are as a
bureaucrat giving up some power compared to your ability to act
individually. That is the trade for working with other people.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Feelings</em>: A process feels bureaucratic when there seems to be a
dissonance. The subject faces a multi-step task that they can imagine
one person doing the same action in fewer steps and taking less time.
The illusion of decreased bureaucracy is created by consolidation from
the subject’s perspective. The barrier to enacting consolidation is the
necessary coordination among different stakeholders who receive no
benefit from the consolidation. Externalizing the coordination to the
subject is what causes the sense of bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-be-an-effective-bureaucrat">How to be
an Effective Bureaucrat</h3>
<p>The following advice is specific to situations that you may not have
yet encountered.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Work on three tasks concurrently.</strong> Don’t
rely on one person or one idea for your success. On the other end of the
spectrum, don’t spread yourself too thin. Working on a multitude of
projects decreases risk of any one outcome failing but also decreases
the amount of attention spent thinking about a specific challenge.</p>
<p>The three tasks should be at off-set stages (early, mid-way, and
nearing completion) rather than all being the same level of
maturity.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: When you get stuck, use the follow changes of perspective:
<strong>Look upstream, look downstream. Look to peers. Zoom in (narrower
scope) and zoom out (broader scope)</strong>. These are all ways of
changing the context. That change may help you identify assumptions
which are holding back progress.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: When you are asked to take on more work, <strong>avoid
responding with “that’s not my job."</strong> If the request is
misguided and your perception is that is really is the responsibility of
another person, ask if the requester is aware of that other person’s
responsibilities. If you are to take on the work, get guidance on
re-prioritizing and make sure the request is documented in writing.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: If there’s something you want to accomplish, <strong>strive
for influence without authority</strong> instead of working to gain
control over resources (e.g., through promotion). Avoid the following:
“In this organization X is important to me, but I can’t do X right now
because I don’t have enough power in the organization. So I’ll get
promoted and then do X."</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Learn the perspectives of those around
you.</strong><br />
The relevance of knowing the paradoxes including dilemmas and
unavoidable hazards, is that you should talk explicitly to your fellow
bureaucrats about these specific topics in conversation. Not that the
goal is to find consensus or agreement. But to find what the other
person is thinking so that you can account for their processes</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Account for holistic view.</strong><br />
The specific circumstances of the challenges you face as a bureaucrat
depend on the individual people involved, what the purpose of the
bureaucracy is, what technology is available for implementation of
bureaucracy, and the resources (staffing, money, time).</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Learn the history of the challenge.</strong><br />
This goes beyond <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton&#39;s_fence">Chesterton’s
fence</a>, which focuses about why the current approach is in placed.
Learning the history of a problem means what has been tried before and
failed? How did the previous iterations evolve into the current
situation? Was the cause personalities, insufficient resources,
inadequate technology? What’s changed that enables this approach to be
better? What do you know that prior attempts didn’t?</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>For a given challenge, work on three
remedies</strong>.<br />
One solution you’re working on may fail, and another may be
inadequate.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Minimize <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">external
costs</a></strong>.<br />
A solution that externalizes costs harms the greater organization and
creates bureaucratic debt.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Exploit the flexibility of rules for the benefit of
all parties.</strong><br />
change the rules of the game and the objectives of the game such that
every participant wins.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Align selfish interests with social
interests.</strong><br />
See also nudges (page 66 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012_Schneier">(Schneier 2012)</span>).</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Find ways to rephrase negative
complaints</strong>.<br />
Negative observation: “Logging into my computer takes a long
time."<br />
Positive statement and explanation of impact: “If the latency for
logging into my computer were lower, I could make more progress on
X."</p>
<p>Negative observation: “The service team I need support from doesn’t
offer a ticketing queue."<br />
Positive statement: “If the service team I need support from offered a
ticketing queue, I would be able to track the work done on my
behalf."</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Share lessons learned</strong>.<br />
This can build your network. People value vulnerability in others; you
can make the first move.</p>

<p>This section takes on the perspective of the subject of bureaucracy
but is meant to be read by bureaucrats who want to improve their <span
data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span>. This book
doesn’t cover advice for subjects of bureaucracy<a href="#fn36"

<p> <br />
When a person has a positive experience engaging with bureaucracy, the
positive attribution is made to the people involved. Or the ease of a
solution makes bureaucracy less visible and the solution seems obvious.
When a person has a negative experience with bureaucracy, complaints are
about the incompetence of the people involved, or the
incomprehensibleness of the system. Don’t these bureaucrats know how to
do their job? Why isn’t the solution obvious? Why does this system not
work for me? David Graeber summarized this view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amongst working-class Americans, government is now generally seen as
being made up of two sorts of people: ‘politicians,’ who are blustering
crooks and liars but can at least occasionally be voted out of office,
and ‘bureaucrats,’ who are condescending elitists almost impossible to
uproot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of bureaucracy (the number of people in an organization)
and the processes of an organization can seem disproportionate to the
apparent complexity of the task. Typically when a person (being a
subject of bureaucracy) interacts with the bureaucratic organization the
artifacts are simple – a check, a form, or a permit. The simplicity of
the artifact does not correlate to the number of decisions made, the
tracking of information, or the precautions taken. All these aspects are
invisible to the subject.</p>
<p>As an example, consider when you go to the doctor and they mend your
broken arm with a cast. That seems straightforward because all you see
is the doctor putting a cast on. You don’t get insight on the decisions
they had to make. Why did they need 20 years of focused schooling to
carry out a procedure that took 15 minutes?</p>
<p>Judging bureaucracy by the artifact visible to the individual subject
under sells the complexity of the decision making necessary to take
action. The contingencies that you were not exposed to because
everything went well make the amount of investment from the bureaucrat
appear wasteful.</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you also lack the ability to
distinguish how much work is attributable to the bureaucrat generating
justifications for their actions (colloquially, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass">covering the
bureaucrat’s ass</a>).</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you typically can’t distinguish when
work is caused by a bureaucrat’s ill-informed decisions. Is the person
stupid, mistaken, or is there something you are not taking into account?
Sometimes the work is carried out by insufficiently trained bureaucrats,
but you don’t get to know whether you’re working with an experienced and
knowledgeable bureaucrat or a new untrained bureaucrat.</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you don’t have visibility on the many
nuances of an organization. The internal power struggles and
organizational politics that depend on personalities, resources, and
competing prioritization are not clear to outsiders. The inconsistency
of an organization’s policies may not be felt by bureaucrats in that
organization. Each bureaucrat may have a different opinion, resulting in
a lack of consistent guidance. There may be legacy policies in
effect.</p>
<p>Effective action by a bureaucratic organization is complicated by the
need for relevant information. Gathering, analyzing, and sharing that
information consistently requires bureaucratic processes. Sometimes the
organization lacks the staffing with relevant skills.</p>
<h2 id="recognize-decision-opportunities">Recognize Decision
Opportunities<span id="sec:dilemma-trilemma"
label="sec:dilemma-trilemma"></span></h2>
<p>When a decision has two viable options (neither being best), that is
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma">dilemma</a>. The name
for a decision with three viable options is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma">trilemma</a>. This section
describes a bureaucrat’s experience of operating within an organization
in terms of dilemmas and trilemmas. Instead of focusing on moral
dilemmas (see <span class="citation" data-cites="2017_Zacka">(Zacka
2017)</span>) or institutional ethics, here I focus on interpersonal
relationships and the logistics of allocating your attention.</p>
<p>Dilemmas are a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning">simple way</a>
of discussing decisions. Dilemmas are a useful framing to highlight the
following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You, an individual bureaucrat, face decisions that you may not
have recognized. Failing to recognize a choice (an error by omission)
can lead to suboptimal results. The dilemmas below are generic to any
bureaucratic process and are intended to stimulate your ability to
identify decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>You face complex trade-offs in your role as a bureaucrat.
Dilemmas are intended an entry point to more nuanced reflection that is
specific to your situation. The dilemmas below are not exhaustive; this
list is merely illustrative.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use dilemmas as an entry to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind">intellectual
empathy</a> with fellow bureaucrats when you recognize they face the
same dilemmas. These dilemmas are generic to the situation and the
person facing the decisions. You now have a topic to discuss with them.
You can share your understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>You can be curious about the choice other bureaucrats select for
a given dilemma. Everyone in the organization faces these decisions, so
these dilemmas give you a topic of conversation to better understand
each bureaucrat’s view.</p></li>
<li><p>You can identify and negotiate potential sources of friction.
Other bureaucrats may arrive at different selections for a given
dilemma, so recognizing this and discussing it can improve the
effectiveness of all involved.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dilemmas explain the inherent complexity of bureaucracy even when
bureaucrats are honest and the purpose of the organization is clear. The
point isn’t that one should <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">select one of the two
options</a>. The point of recognizing a dilemma is that it is a marker
that there is a decision to be made. Once the need for a decision is
identified, the action for the bureaucrat is not to select one of the
two options. The effective bureaucrat identifies nuances, enumerates
alternatives, and talks with fellow bureaucrats about these decisions.
Rather than seeking consensus, strive for comprehension of other
people’s perspective. That way you can navigate decision making
processes more effectively.</p>
<p>The choices described below in the simplified representation of
dilemmas are intended as a starting point for introducing the decision
space relevant to individual bureaucrats. Do not accept the dilemmas
presented here as the final framing. Thinking in terms of a limited
spectrum of opportunities neglects nuances that enable more creative
approaches. Awareness of these dilemmas and trilemmas are intended to
spark creative imagination about the nuances specific to your
situation.</p>
<p>By recognizing the deficiencies of dilemmas, you can identify nuances
specific to the situation you are in. Instead of responding to the
recognition of a decision with “should I do this or that?” the better
option is to assess the complexities and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming">brainstorm</a>
multiple options. Talk with stakeholders and understand the history of
the situation before making a choice and taking action.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-dilemmas-arise-in-bureaucracy">How
Dilemmas Arise in Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The existence of dilemmas is not obvious or natural. Given a task,
the simplest response for an individual is to take action and be done.
There wasn’t a decision needed.</p>
<p>If the task is more challenging then first <u>make a plan</u> and
then <u>take action</u> and be done. The source of the challenge may be
task complexity, scale, number of people effected, diversity of
stakeholders, amount of time needed, how the current task shapes future
options, or the number of collaborators. Regardless of why the task is
challenging, a dilemma has already arisen: how much time to spend
planning versus doing.</p>
<p>If the task is even more challenging, it may be useful to gather data
for the plan, then make a plan, then take action and be done. A new
dilemma arises: how much time to spend gathering data versus planning.
The previous dilemma still exists – how much time to invest in planning
versus doing. As an alternative to the dilemma framing, how much time
should be allocated to three categories of activity?</p>
<p>But wait, how did the person in the first scenario (just do the task)
know no plan was necessary? Either it was an explicit choice or they
didn’t perceive the need to decide about whether to plan. Someone else
faced with that same task might choose differently, e.g., to make a
plan. The task complexity is relative to the person’s skills,
experiences, expectations about stakeholders, and potential
ramifications.</p>
<p>In this escalating sequence of increasingly challenging tasks, now
suppose the task involves you and another person. The overhead of
coordination inflicts other dilemmas. The examples of complexity arising
from coordination are identified in the list of dilemmas below, e.g. <a
href="#table:micromanaging" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:micromanaging">4.4</a>, <a
href="#table:early-intervention" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:early-intervention">4.3</a>.</p>
<p>An independent source of friction for distributed decision making and
distributed knowledge is when people involved in the task don’t agree on
how challenging it is. The framing of the difficulty matters because it
can lead different participants to distinct conclusions about how much
time should be spent planning versus for carrying out the action. The
choice of “how complicated is the task?” shapes the team dynamics and
informs the need for hierarchical roles.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="folk-wisdom-on-decision-making">Folk Wisdom
on Decision Making</h3>
<p>Bureaucrats, whether hired for their expertise or simply to provide
labor, are rarely experts on decision making. There are multiple domains
in which <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">decision making</a>
is studied (e.g., <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory">economics</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">mathematics</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making">psychology</a>),
but practicing bureaucrats are more likely familiar with colloquialisms
that feel descriptive. A few are provided here to give a sense of both
the conciseness (relevant for memetic propagation) and the lack of
prescriptive action in each meme.</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy’s law</a>:
“Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.”</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law">Hick’s law</a>:
“Increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time
logarithmically.”</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon’s
razor</a>: “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained
by stupidity.”</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s
law</a>: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its
completion.”</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Law of
Triviality</a>: “People within an organization commonly or typically
give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.”</p>
<p> <br />
Each of these memes feel descriptive to the practicing bureaucrat. They
survive because of their self-encapsulation; no more thought needed.
There is also nothing actionable about these memes.</p>
<p>In comparison to the folk expressions above, dilemmas are intended to
be accessible to practicing bureaucrats and serve as a starting point
for reflection and discussion resulting in action. Effective action is
enabled by improved understanding of the trade-offs faced within an
organization. Rather than being reductive, the purpose of cataloging
bureaucratic dilemmas is to first point out that there is a choice. Once
the choice is recognized, look for ways to think beyond the
dichotomy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-dilemmas-oversimplify">How Dilemmas
Oversimplify</h3>
<p>Although the following concepts are presented as dilemmas and
trilemmas, these are necessarily simplifications. For example, two ways
to simplify situations into a dilemma are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with a single variable, e.g., “how much data to gather",
and force it into a binary choice “more data gathering" versus “less
data gathering."</p></li>
<li><p>Start with a complex trade-off space with many opportunities and
reduce it to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dichotomy</a>
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_thinking">zero-sum
options</a>: “more data gathering" vs “more planning." The actual
trade-space involves optimization of multiple goals, like (maximize
productivity) and (minimize unnecessary risk) and (maximize quality) and
(maximize employee satisfaction) and (minimize latency).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The over-simplifications listed below neglect both the continuous
nature of the trade-offs and the alternative creative approaches to a
specific situation.</p>
<p>Rather than waiting until the need manifests, ponder these dilemmas
prior to the pressure of real-time decision making. Recognize dilemmas
and trilemmas and then extend your analysis beyond them by adapting to
the local conditions and specific people available to help. Dilemmas
should not be resolved by you alone. Talk with subordinates, peers,
mentors, customers, and supervisors.</p>
<p>Once a dilemma is recognized, it is easier to defer and avoid the
decision making process<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>. Delaying a decision longer than
necessary ripples out along the chain of dependencies.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="dilemmas-are-not-purely-intellectual">Dilemmas are not Purely
Intellectual</h3>
<p>Decision making is not a purely intellectual task; there is emotional
stress induced by the process. Dilemmas create cognitive dissonance for
the decision maker. Any selection is going to have downsides, and
compromise can be suboptimal. Those burdens weigh morally on deciders
because of the consequences on other people.</p>
<p>To counter this morale weight, talk with other people about
decisions. Even if this does not alleviate the responsibility of
deciding, discussion can help you arrive at new insights.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="more-complications">More Complications</h3>
<p>Adding to the difficulty and stress, dilemmas presented here occur
concurrently and continuously. The dilemmas are inter-dependent due to
both to the common variables and the constrained resources. Selecting an
option for one dilemma alters the options available in other
dilemmas.</p>
<p>Oscillation between approaches can be caused by change of management,
accumulation of experience (dissatisfaction) with one solution, the
desire for promotion within the hierarchy (where change is presented as
progress), or a desire for cost savings (efficiency). The rate of
oscillation is an indicator of the half-life of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_memory">institutional
memory for an organization</a>.</p>
<p>The dilemmas identified below for generic bureaucracy are just a
baseline. For the culture you are in and the project you’re working on
and the people you’re working with, there will be more dilemmas to
identify.</p>
<p> <br />
The following two sections categorize dilemmas as <a
href="#sec:personal-policy-dilemmas">personal policies</a></p>
<p>and policies regarding <a href="#sec:org-dilemma">structure of the
organization</a>.</p>
<p>The personal policies apply to each bureaucrat in an organization,
while the structural policies for an organization are faced by a subset
of bureaucrats in the management role.</p>

Dilemmas <span id="sec:personal-policy-dilemmas"

<p>In practice, the following decisions are unordered and are constantly
faced by the bureaucrat. As observed by Lindblom in <span
class="citation" data-cites="1959_Lindblom">(Lindblom 1959)</span>, this
flurry of decisions contrasts to a regularized process that might be
envisioned as optimal.</p>

</div>
<p>The <a href="table:focus-vs-systemic">Dilemma of Aperture</a> is
defined in terms of scope of the challenge. An adjacent dilemma is the
question of whether to focus on short-term tasks or long-term tasks. The
right balance of how long tasks take is more project management then
bureaucratic. I try to identify a small number of long-term tasks, then
divide each into smaller (shorter) tasks. The dependencies of the
smaller tasks then determine the order of the work.</p>
<p>The <a href="table:focus-vs-systemic">Dilemma of Aperture</a> is not
specific to bureaucracy, but commonly arises because isolated problems
rarely exist. Challenges occur as part of larger systemic contexts.
Addressing the immediate problem leaves the system issue, and tackling
system issues are more difficult and take longer.</p>
<p>Your selection of narrow versus wide within the <a
href="table:focus-vs-systemic">Dilemma of Aperture</a> depends on what
you find emotionally rewarding. Other bureaucrats may gain emotional
enjoyment from approaches to problem solving that you do not. Finding
ways to leverage that difference (rather than minimizing it) is
useful.</p>
<p>Organizations typically incentivize short-term behavior. Annual
performance reviews and quarterly feedback cycles might miss systemic
changes that take multiple years to enact. Identifying incremental
milestones is one response, though that isn’t always feasible. Another
approach is to only report a subset of your activities (the ones that
yield short-term results).</p>

<p>The <a href="table:speak-up-or-hold-back">Dilemma of Speaking</a>

about subjective policy. You may see someone doing something that

optimization objective is. Or that person may be unaware of the waste,
or they may not be aware there is a more effective way to carry out the
action.</p>
<p>Resolving differences of opinion is not always necessary. If all

eased when you have relationships with other bureaucrats that allow you

<p>Whether the culture of an organization promotes speaking up or not

<p>If you decide to respond to the <a
href="table:notes-or-no-notes">Dilemma of Documentation</a> by taking
notes and sharing them, your coworkers get value from your notes. Your
investment saves them time and allows them to search through old notes.
As a new member of a team, this is an easy way to provide value.</p>
<p>A limiting factor biasing a bureaucrat towards the “no documentation”
extreme is the ability to take good notes during or after conversations.
That can be limited by ability to multi-task (listen and write), or
memory of what was said, or hand-writing. Another bottleneck is the time
needed for writing notes.</p>
<p>A standard response to the idea of taking notes is, “I remember what
happened." These memories can be spotty, biased, and are verbal stories
rather than artifacts. Relying on memory to recall events doesn’t work
for everyone.</p>

<p>The <a href="table:forest-vs-trees">Dilemma of Think or Do</a> is
pervasive in bureaucracy. Any time not spent taking action looks
wasteful, while investing too little thought can result in wasteful
action.</p>
<p>Coordinating with other bureaucrats magnifies the challenge. If
different bureaucrats allocate different amounts of time to planning and
acting, then each person interrupts others. This is unavoidable.
Effective bureaucrats default to early coordination instead of waiting
to see how others respond.</p>
<p>The <a href="table:forest-vs-trees">Dilemma of Think or Do</a>
applies at the scale of individual bureaucrats and to the collective
behavior of teams and organizations. The time it takes a team to respond
is longer than that of an individual, and the time an organization takes
is longer than that of a team. A common mistake is to apply the
timescale relevant to an individual to a team or organization.</p>
<p>Inaction is usually a safe response to a situation. Admiring the
problem, studying the options, or continuing to work on other issues are
common behaviors. Only when circumstances threaten relationships or the
team or organization is action taken.</p>

<p>When you first hear of a challenge, you may be interested in
immediately tackling it. You see a path to improvement, you have the
skills needed, and addressing the challenge would benefit your team.
Unbeknownst to you, another person on another team saw that same
challenge and had the same reaction.</p>
<p>Because of the distributed nature of knowledge and decision making in
bureaucracy, the <a href="table:meetings-versus-work">Dilemma of
Coordinate or Do</a> is happening all the time for many aspect of the
subjective decisions being made. Advertising “I’m going to do something"
and “I’m doing something" and “I did something" as you are progressing
on any given task is vital to decreasing the likelihood of unintentional
duplication. Even that activity of advertising and listening to the
advertisements of other bureaucrats takes time away from doing your
work.</p>
<p>The <a href="table:meetings-versus-work">Dilemma of Coordinate or
Do</a> is a cause of conflict among bureaucrats who prioritize doing the
work versus bureaucrats who see value in checking in with others first.
The constraint of time allocation and variety of views leads to friction
in organizations.</p>
<p>As with <a href="table:forest-vs-trees">Dilemma of Think or Do</a>,
inaction is the safer default. Having a meeting is less risky than
investing time in creating a prototype.</p>

<p>Just as there are two views of micromanagement (<a

data-reference="table:solution-provider">4.5</a> and <a
href="#table:micromanaging" data-reference-type="ref"

from the supervisor’s view and the subordinate’s view. The <a
href="table:work-extra-or-work-as-expected">Dilemma of Working extra
hard</a> is the view of the subordinate. Unlike jobs in which labor is
directly tied to financial profit, a bureaucrat has a weak feedback loop
for their labor. Promotion may (but is not guaranteed to) happen in the
future based on your current level of effort.</p>
<p>The <a href="table:work-extra-or-work-as-expected">Dilemma of Working
extra hard</a> creates competition among bureaucrats competing for a
limited pool of promotions. Because organizations rely on hierarchy, and
hierarchy is correlated with pay, promotion is typically not based
purely on the merits of an individual bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Promotions exist to bias bureaucrats towards the “extra labor for
reduced wages" outcome. Bureaucrats who have enough income and autonomy
may not see promotions as relevant and thus be comfortable at their
current workload. There are other <a

<p>The <a href="table:bad-news-up-the-chain">Dilemma of Bad News</a> is
a consequence of hierarchical reporting in organizations. Regardless of
whether the hierarchy stems from specialization of skills or delegation
of decisions, information traverses up the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy">chain of
command</a>.</p>
<p>News going up the chain of command is subject to modifications – both
filtering and embellishment. Filtering out bad news or making the report
more grandiose can be spun as contextualization. Which outcome is
preferred depends on the specific people reading the reports. Whether to
report an update is one choice, how to spin it is another. Did the team
fail to accomplish their objective, or did the team learn something that
will inform the next phase of their progress?</p>
<p>The <a href="table:bad-news-up-the-chain">Dilemma of Bad News</a>
applies to peer-to-peer relations and supervisor-to-subordinate, but in
those two relationships the repercussions of bad news are less. Being

<p>Managing shared resources in a dynamic environment necessitates
changes to policies and processes. Change, whether incremental or
revolutionary, threatens incumbent stakeholders who hold power based on
current practices.</p>
<p>Incremental change provides quicker feedback but requires
understanding and integrating with the existing bureaucracy.
Revolutionary change is easier to get started but you will have to
relearn the lessons the incumbent already knows.</p>
<p>The <a href="table:disruptive-or-iterative">Dilemma of Innovation</a>
can be disheartening for bureaucrats. The innovation is usually intended
to improve the team or organization, so resistance to change demoralizes
the bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Being an innovator (whether incremental or disruptive) can gain you
supporters and friends as well as more negative reactions – what does
that person think they are doing? That person is so naive.</p>
<p>A good indicator that you’re on a useful path is when your support is
from people with less to lose (at the bottom of the organization’s
hierarchy) and when the resistance is from people who have more status
and power to lose (top of the hierarchy). However, that could merely be
a sign your idea is popular and naive.</p>

<p>Deployment of products in industry and deployment of policies in a
bureaucracy face similar dilemmas. The <a

of Innovation</a> describes how innovation is adopted by people with
different amounts of risk tolerance.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy arises to manage shared resources. Management occurs by
policies and processes. The community accessing the shared resource
changes over time, so the policies and processes evolve to reflect that
change. The <a href="table:consistency">Dilemma of Consistency over
time</a> is about the degree of incrementalism of the change.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats responsible for carrying out policies and processes
disagree on the question of stability. This disagreement generates
friction for other processes reliant on those relations within an
organization. The <a href="table:consistency">Dilemma of Consistency

<p>Bureaucrats are incentivized to avoid change, so the bias in this

<p>Bureaucracy involves coordination to facilitate distributed knowledge

attention. When communication channels are instantaneous (e.g., phone,
email, video) there is often more information to be consumed. The <a

<p>Grove <span class="citation" data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove
1995)</span> calls the centralized model functional teams.</p>
<p>Centralization is often carried out for the purposes of cost
efficiency. The cost savings are due to de-duplication and having less
slack. Both of those “savings” are a decrease of redundancy, which has a
cost when there are unexpected fluctuations in need.</p>
<p>Another motive for centralization is to concentrate talent within the
organization. This can have the unintentional result of silo’ing talent
and isolating experts from the people they want to help.</p>
<p>Decentralized manifests as cross-functional teams. Do the compliance
officers or financial people or IT support staff work directly on your
team locally or are they in a separate team?</p>
<p>Rate of change between centralized and decentralized may be a
function of turnover or promotion rates.</p>
<p>A matrixed organization <span class="citation"
data-cites="1985_NASA">(Mulligan 1985)</span> mixes the centralized
approach and cross-functional team.</p>
<p>Centralization is an intentional monopolization, with the
corresponding decrease in choices. Centralization (de-localization) can
decrease the value assigned to feedback from people using the service
because personal relations are de-valued.</p>
<p>The weaker feedback, lack of redundancy, and decreased emphasis on
relationships motivates the creation of local services.</p>

<p>There is a Goldilocks situation for number of processes in an
organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Too few processes (all social relationships).</p></li>
<li><p>Just the right amount – a balance process and social, and when to
use which is known.</p></li>
<li><p>Too much process (not enough leveraging of social
relationships)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This optimization is like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer curve</a> in
economics.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Trilemma</em>: <strong>Do you support the cutting edge, most of the
middle, or the laggards?</strong><br />
For any given aspect of bureaucracy there is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">bell curve</a>
of skills and interest of bureaucrats. In your role of bureaucrat you
face a choice: find and collaborate with and enable the best and
brightest, or aim your efforts at the massive mediocre middle (most
bureaucrats), or try to get the dumbest bureaucrats up to speed?</p>
<p>Trying to escape the trilemma by claiming that you treat everyone
equally means you are disregarding the needs of the tail of the
distribution.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Trilemma</em>: <strong>Do you work for your team, your manager, or
yourself?</strong><br />
Being a member of a team that operates within a hierarchy is tough. One
reason is the question of who you are working for. The trilemma is
whether you work for yourself, work for your supervisor, or work for
your team. Ideally you can find ways to do all three, but that is not
always the case.</p>
<p>Members of the team should work collaboratively, but there is a
potential counter-force: accountability to the supervisor. Because each
team member is accountable to their supervisor(s), that motivates the
action of the individual. The team does not actually have autonomy –
they are accountable to the boss.</p>
<p>In the approach “team members are directed by their supervisor," the
synergy of the team is neglected and the supervisor becomes a bottleneck
(for decision making and for creativity and for planning).</p>
<p>The third approach is for a person to ignore their team and their
supervisor. This might enable quicker progress, at the risk of going in
an unhelpful direction or not leveraging skills of coworkers.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Trilemma</em>: <strong>Seek less budget, same, or larger
budget.</strong> Less budget is needed if you improved efficiency, but
then the proportional power within the organization is decreased. A
larger budget may be due to inefficiency or growth. Keeping the same
budget indicates no promotions are relevant (although a steady state
could result from a combination of growth and improved efficency).</p>
<p> <br />
A trilemma applicable to many situations is that options are
<strong>fast, inexpensive, good; choose two</strong>. (This is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">Project
management triangle</a>.)<br />
In other words, the options are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Good and fast is expensive (i.e., requires lots of
resources).</p></li>
<li><p>Good and inexpensive takes a long time (i.e., find a clever
solution).</p></li>
<li><p>Fast and inexpensive will be low quality.</p></li>

Dilemma-based Framing</h4>
<p>There are many dilemmas listed above but the list is not
comprehensive. Even if each bureaucrat considers the same choices (which
doesn’t necessarily happen), not everyone makes the same selection.</p>
<p>To avoid dilemmas, a response might be to defer to someone higher in
the hierarchy to decide and coordinate. While fewer people making
decisions would improve consistency, this would be <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement">micromanagement</a>.
The people in the hierarchy above the person facing the choice don’t
have exposure to the problem. Choices are delegated to leverage
expertise.</p>
<p> <br />
When you are facing these dilemmas and trilemmas there are constructive
responses that can improve your effectiveness. Improvement benefits your
results, your reputation, and the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collect quantitative data for each variable. Quantitative
arguments can augment qualitative stories.</p></li>
<li><p>Construct the Pareto frontier to identify non-optimal choices
that can be eliminated.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of assessing variables in isolation, assess consequences
in the context of workflows and effects on stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss subjective decisions with stakeholders so that potential
disagreements can be negotiated instead of creating friction.</p></li>

Bureaucracy<span id="sec:unavoidable-hazards"
label="sec:unavoidable-hazards"></span></h2>
<p>In a bureaucracy there are certain challenges that cannot be avoided.
The value of recognizing them is to understand that what you’re
experiencing isn’t an anomaly. The problem isn’t unique to you, your
circumstances, your coworkers, or the organization. The cause is the
combination of all those factors.</p>
<p>Good ideas are not enough for adoption or continuation. Concepts
critical to the success of the organization do not need to continue.
Emotional fortitude is critical.</p>
<p> <br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Separation of responsibility and
accountability</strong>.<br />
Each bureaucrat in an organization has responsibilities associated with
their role. The ability to complete the tasks associated the role are
not wholly within the scope of the bureaucrat’s control. You are
dependent on other bureaucrats. Even if there is a desire for action,
the action might not be immediately feasible because of a dependence on
another person or process.</p>
<p>The consequence of separation of responsibility from authority is
that other people look incompetent or lazy and unresponsive.</p>
</div>
<p> <br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Appreciation for being an effective
bureaucrat is rare.</strong><br />
If you do your job well no one will notice. This is because of an
expectation of smooth and fast interactions. Frictionless engagement is
expected even if that is not the norm.</p>
<p>Consider teachers who catch cheating students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No one [thanks teachers] for policing cheating. Not the cheaters,
not the honest students who feel inconvenienced and mistrusted, and
certainly not the school [administrators] who have to process academic
dishonesty paperwork.”<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This same concept applies to any bureaucrat. The number of thank you
cards sent to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug
Administration</a> meat inspectors keeping food safe, <a
href="https://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and Health
Administration</a> regulators ensuring a safe work environment, <a
href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a>
detecting disruptive electromagnetic signals, <a
href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, and <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> is
likely small.</p>
<p>There are counter examples in public service bureaucracy. Law
enforcement is thanked when there is a victim of a crime. The military
is held in high regard. In both of those bureaucracies the bureaucrats
are visible and the consequence of their work is tangible.</p>
<p>In large organizations there are teams of bureaucrats like the
Information technology department and human resources. IT support
bureaucrats are occasionally thanked by their subjects, though most of
the time the expectation is that computers should just work. HR produces
no tangible products, so the appreciation is lower.</p>
<p> <br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Lack of accountability to fellow bureaucrats
who rely on you.</strong><br />
You are more likely to feel accountable to your supervisor. Performing
for your supervisor and explaining your value matters more than the work
done to support coworkers. This also applies when you depend on other
people – they aren’t accountable to you.</p>
<p>To counter this tendency, build personal relationships with peers.
This requires on-going investment, both to maintain relationships and to
create bonds with new coworkers as your previous coworkers leave.</p>
</div>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Decision-makers are under-informed and
inexperienced.</strong><br />
You can make a decision with insufficient information. There is rarely
an expectation of expertise or experience. Gathering information takes
time and is thus burdensome. Having experience requires getting
experience – you either start as a novice and make mistakes, have formal
academic training, or rely on mentorship to avoid direct experience of
mistakes.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Gathering data for decisions takes resources
and expertise.</strong><br />
When there is a desire to gather data, and there is data available to be
gathered, an investment of time is necessary. Well-informed decisions
take time, experience, or both.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Defining success is subjective and
dynamic</strong>.<br />
Who defines success and for which audience in a bureaucratic
organization is subjective because of the lack of feedback mechanisms.
Consequences may not be immediately obvious. Worse, how success is
defined can be changed at any time – there’s no need for
consistency.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Change threatens incumbents</strong>.<br />
Change of plans, roles, tasks, resources, flatness of org, scope,
technology.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility">Diffusion
of responsibility</a> in the bureaucracy</strong>.<br />
A specific task needs to be completed, and action requires involvement
of multiple collaborators.</p>
<p>Once responsibility is assigned, the new risk is that of blame.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Diffusion of blame in the
bureaucracy</strong>.<br />
Example: if something goes wrong, who is at fault: the creator of a
policy or the person tasked with executing the policy?</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>High latency feedback</strong>.<br />
See <a href="#sec:slow-deployment">slow deployment of processes</a> on
page  and <a href="#sec:decision-delay">decision delay</a> on page .</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Weak feedback</strong>.<br />
Suppose my bureaucratic task depends on a service provided by you, a
fellow bureaucrat. If your computer isn’t working, your ability to
provide the service is blocked by a dependency on a computer repair
person. You might feel relieved – you can relax while you wait on the
computer repair and you don’t have to do work providing the service to
me. You might feel anxious – you’re unable to provide the service until
the computer is fixed. Regardless of how you feel about the situation,
my task is blocked. If neither you nor I have priority relative to the
computer repair person’s other tasks, then we wait. This question of
priority could be resolved hierarchically (for which there is limited
attention bandwidth) or socially (dependent on someone having a
relationship with the repair person).</p>
<p>The delay for my task may be sufficiently small that raising the
issue through the hierarchy or socially is not a good use of time.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The person making the rules that you follow
doesn’t actually know what they’re doing</strong>.<br />
Your choices then include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow the rules that are not correct. This harms your
productivity and morale.</p></li>
<li><p>You can violate the rules and be more effective. This puts you at
risk for sanctions.</p></li>
<li><p>You can work the change the rules. Then you are not doing the
work that’s needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>You rarely get to pick who is on the
team</strong>.<br />
When a task requires collaboration, there is rarely a choice of who you
get to work with.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>You rarely get to alter team
membership.</strong> As a team member, you typically get little input on
who you work with. Even as a manager your options for hiring are often
limited.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Fear of the unknown.</strong><br />
Current suffering is tolerable compared to the uncertainty of change,
especially when the suffering isn’t felt by the decision maker.</p>
<p>By identifying this fear in yourself or those you collaborate with,
you can discuss specific concerns and work to address them.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Fear of change.</strong><br />
Change disrupts the status quo, putting accumulated power at risk and
altering relationships.</p>
<p>An emotional basis for decision making (or avoidance of decision
making) may or may not be rational. Discussing the fear with fellow
bureaucrats can ease the burden.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Fear of conflict.</strong> Refers to conflict
of ideas, not physical conflict. Conflict of ideas is not personal,
though the consequences may have impacts on careers for
stakeholders.<br />
Professional disagreement is to be expected in a bureaucratic
organization.</p>
<p>Feeling uncomfortable is distinct from feeling unsafe. Communicating
while feeling discomfort is a useful skill, rather than avoidance. You
can demonstrate courage by talking about your sense of discomfort.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Inadequate resources: staffing, time,
money.</strong><br />
The resources you have to address a challenge may not match the
complexity of the issue.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Outcomes for the team are ill-defined and
constantly shifting.</strong><br />
Most bureaucrats rely on approaches that assume consistency of their
environment. Planning for uncertainty and change is more
complicated.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The reward for good work is more
work.</strong><br />
When a coworker doesn’t do their fair share, then the productive
employee shoulders more burden. The deficient worker has no incentive to
improve</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The organization has a lack of vision; or has
vision but no plan; or has vision and a plan but no consensus; or has
vision and a plan and consensus but inadequate resources.</strong><br />
An organization of bureaucrats can operate without a vision or plan or
sufficient resources. Being busy is easy, being productive is hard.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Progress depends on subjective decision
making.</strong><br />
Rarely is the optimal path deterministic.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Easier to ask for big money than small
money.</strong><br />
Processes are scale invariant. Regardless of whether you’re asking for
$1000 or $100,000, the process is the same. Accountability processes for
large amounts of money are not scaled down to fit small amounts because
people can be as dumb with $100 as they are with $10,000.</p>
<p>People problems are invariant of where in the hierarchy the problems
occur. Less attention is paid to the same problem at the lowest levels
as compared to higher in the hierarchy.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Flux of people and processes.</strong><br />
Sources of flux include staff turn-over, changing conditions, changing
timelines, change of vision, and the need to be promoted. In a
bureaucracy, consistency doesn’t yield promotion.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Why are there so many rules?</strong><br />
To address edge cases and malicious or dumb people. See the <a
href="table:dilemma-forms">Dilemma of Forms</a> on page .</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>So much paperwork or forms.</strong> Why is Red
tape endemic to bureaucracy?<br />
Paperwork as a form of coordination in processes to facilitate
decentralized decision making.</p>
<p>One of the motives for paperwork is to catch people who are
misrepresenting their intent, whether accidental or intentional.
Documentation makes prosecution more straightforward.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Everything is slower.</strong><br />
What is meant is “slower than desired" or “slower than I imagined in my
simplified model."</p>
<p>One reason progress is slower than expected is because there aren’t
as many hours available as imagined.</p>
<p>In a bureaucracy the actual time spent working is less than the
number of hours you get paid for. Breaks during work, vacation from
work, holidays, sick leave. See figure <a href="#fig:hours_per_year"
data-reference-type="ref"

<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy inhibits
creativity.</strong><br />
See notes on <a href="#sec:innovation">innovation</a> on page .</p>
</div>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy grows.</strong><br />
The causes of growth include scope creep, an increased number of people
participating in the process, an increased workload, or the ratio of
workers to managers decreases.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy grows because some people lie. The progress is called
“improved accountability" because we aren’t sure who the next liar is
going to be. More work is created for everyone because we don’t want to
confront the liars and cheats.</p>
<p>You can measure the growth of bureaucracy using metrics like the
latency in addressing a request and the number of people involved in
addressing a request.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing the size of a bureaucracy is easier than cutting
it down.</strong><br />
 <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The larger a hierarchy, the ratio of workers to
managers gets worse</strong>.<br />
As complexity and workload increase, the number of staff needed
increase. To facilitate coordination, managers arise. The amount of work
being done in a bureaucracy can be small compared to the number of
participants.</p>
<p>In figure <a href="#fig:growth_of_bureaucracy"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:growth_of_bureaucracy">4.6</a>a, the ratio of
workers to participants is 3:3=1. When a manager is added, the ratio is
3:4 = 0.75 (a lower value means less apparent work per employee is being
done). Adding a second team with dedicated management puts the ratio at
6:9=0.66. Finally, with a dedicated administrative team (e.g., payroll,
hiring, facilities), the ratio is 6:13=0.46.</p>
<p>Adding more people to a hierarchical organization results in
diminishing returns for time spent on the central work since bureaucrats
invest time maintaining the hierarchy and administrative processes.</p>

<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Each person in a bureaucracy has multiple
roles</strong>.<br />
To limit the expansion of the bureaucracy. The multiple roles come from
multiple relationships necessary to span an organization larger than <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>.  <br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Everything is more
complicated</strong>.<br />
Bureaucracy administers access to resources, whether tangible items
(water, air) or expertise. There’s friction for tangible resources
because the easiest solution is you get the resource (without an
intermediary). There’s friction for expertise because the expert
understands things you do not.</p>
</div>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is inefficient and
wasteful.</strong><br />
The inefficiency of an organization is not just due to a breakdown of
communication among its many members. Different individuals in different
roles faced distinct incentives and have a different view of what
problem is most relevant. There is a mixture of competition and
cooperation internally for resources.</p>
<p>Can you explain a Pareto frontier for multiple objectives like speed,
cost, accuracy?</p>
<p>Because decisions by bureaucrats are subjective, there is significant
risk of being wrong or being called out by others as being wrong.
Therefore, a motive to cover your ass for decisions made. Unnecessary
work is carried out.</p>
<p>Different participants have different motives, and the aggregation
needed for coordination is inefficient regardless of what metric
efficiency is measured against.</p>
<p>Another example: Inefficiency of changing the requirements on a
project partway through. If an objective quantitative measure were
available, the return on investment could be determined.</p>
<p>Efficiency is typically assessed from the perspective of a serial
process – a single worker could do this task faster, so why involve 10
people and get a slower, more burdensome result? The Mythical Man Month
manifests <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s law</a>.
Dividing a task among 10 people does not make the task 10x quicker. It’s
not valid to expect that a task which takes 1 person 1 hour to perfectly
scale so 10 people should be able to accomplish 10 results in 1
hour.</p>
<p>Inefficiency of process is similar. I need to file a request to
replace the lightbulb in my office. Compared to the serial “I’ll just
replace the lightbulb myself by running to the hardware store and
purchasing one."</p>
<p>The excess resources characterized as waste are similarly driven by
the serial-based assessment of what one person would require to carry
out the task.</p>
<p> <br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Scope creep.</strong><span
id="sec:scope-creep" label="sec:scope-creep"></span><br />
Scope creep can originate from three sources: the bureaucrat doing the
work, the customer of the bureaucrat’s work, and the bureaucrat
management. In the first situation, the person doing the work might see
a nearby opportunity that only requires a little be more work.</p>
</div>
<p>When the customer is the source of scope creep, the root cause is
that customer wants more. While the exploration of what’s possible can
be exciting (a positive experience), what the bureaucrat hears is more
work and delayed results. This implies a few trade-off options, all of
which are negative for one or both parties.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stick with the original terms (telling the customer “no", which
is negative for both parties).</p></li>
<li><p>Re-negotiation for more time (a burden to both parties).</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat doing more for the same pay, which means less
money per effort (yielding a less happy bureaucrat).</p></li>
<li><p>Decreasing existing efforts to fit the added requirements
(yielding a less happy customer).</p></li>
<li><p>Even if the bureaucrat is getting paid by the hour, more work
means the end product will be delayed to accommodate added features
(yielding a less happy customer).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The third source of scope creep is from management. Executive
decision makers tried to make decisions without having the full context
of the impacts of the decisions. Lower level people doing things see
opportunities and extend their scope incorrectly because they don’t have
the full picture. In both these cases, the problem is that the person
doesn’t know what they don’t know and trying to solve problems outside
of their knowledge. How would that person know that they don’t know? The
easy answer to this is if you are in a position of authority, check
downward before making a pronouncement. If you are in a position of
execution, check upward before taking action. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military)#Commander&#39;s_intent">Commander’s
intent</a> works in both directions.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Migrating technologies.</strong><br />
The person enacting the transition has to be educated in both the old
and new technology. The legacy code has to be migrated to the new
implementation convincing stakeholders; may require synchronization

<h2 id="what-to-read">What to Read<span id="sec:to-read"

<p>The content of this book is independent of the specific role you as a
bureaucrat will be playing. I assume you are striving to be a good
person, and that you have relevant education/experience for the position
in the organization.</p>

<p>Reading management books is helpful regardless of whether you are a
manager, want to become a manager, or if you never want to become a
manager. In all three cases, gaining awareness of best practices and
alternative approaches benefits you as a bureaucrat and the people you
coordinate with – bosses, peer bureaucrats, subordinates, and subjects.
Voluntary membership in a long-lasting organization implies a turnover
rate. organizations constantly have to onboard of new members.</p>
<p>An organization is distinct from the rest of society due to the

will cease to be distinguishable from society.</p>

<h2 id="hiring-into-a-bureaucracy">Hiring into a Bureaucracy<span
id="sec:hiring" label="sec:hiring"></span></h2>
<p>Hiring shapes the culture of an organization and determines what is
feasible, both by the skills of those hired and how well new hires
integrate with the existing organization.</p>
<p>Hiring is an expensive process in terms of money, time, emotional
investment of candidates, and the burden of reviewing applicants. As a
candidate, recognize the risk the organization is taking. As a reviewer
of candidates, this is an investment in the future of the organization.
Even if your bureaucratic role does not require an exclusive focus on
hiring, there is value in studying this domain.</p>
<p>When hiring into an organization there is a selection bias in the
people who join a bureaucracy, and there is a selection bias who stays
in bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specifics of the job, there are specific attributes
that make a candidate more likely to be successful in a bureaucracy. In
addition to role-specific skills, hire for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>,
social skills, and intrinsic motivation.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-getting-started">Tips for Getting Started</h2>
<p>You may have graduated from school with a degree in a specific
subject. Then you go to work and expect the position you’re in to apply
the domain-specific education you have at work. That work produces an
outcome and gives meaning to the struggle of educational process (time,
money, effort). When you are not allowed to practice what you went to
school for the disconnect may feel dissatisfying.</p>
<p>An alternative attitude is that you went to school to learn how to
learn. A degree represents your ability to learn and persist, rather
than a domain specialization. Then, when you get to work, you are
presented with new opportunities to learn other domains.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="onboarding-into-a-bureaucratic-organization">Onboarding into a
Bureaucratic Organization</h3>
<p>There are two parties in hiring. Responsibility for successful
integration relies on both parties actively working together.</p>
<p> <br />
As the new hire, make an effort to learn the names of those around
you.<br />
As the hirer, make introductions. Not just the first time, but for the
first week or two.</p>
<p> <br />
As the new hire, learn the jargon.<br />
As the hirer, explicitly expand jargon.</p>
<p> <br />
As the new hire, seek one-on-ones.<br />
As the hirer, offer one-on-ones.</p>
<p> <br />
As the new hire, write documentation on processes.<br />
As the hirer, provide documentation on processes.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-orient-yourself">How to Orient
Yourself</h3>
<p>Sometimes your role as a bureaucrat may be poorly defined. The lack
of direction or objectives may be feel disappointing or frustrating. The
positive perspective is that you get to define your tasks and determine
what would be useful or interesting.</p>
<p>Two mentalities that I find useful are enabling others and working
myself out of the job. My goal is to facilitate success rather than
being integral to the process. Enabling other people to be successful
can apply to customers, fellow bureaucrats, or management. Not everyone
matters equally, so figuring out the relevance of helping specific
people impacts your decision.</p>
<p>Another tactic I use is to look around, look backwards, and look
forward. What are the challenges my team or my organization faces? Then
review previous attempts to address the challenges. Why did previous
efforts fail to remedy the situation? Once I have a less naive view and
more context, what is my vision of the desired scenario? Without this
vision there is a danger of doing work that keeps me busy but yields no
progress.</p>
<p>The tactics of identifying challenges and learning the history of a
challenge often relies on social interactions. A bureaucratic
organization rarely maintains a searchable written record of decisions
and failed efforts. If that content is available, it may lack the
specificity available from oral narrative by people who were present.
When investigating issues in a bureaucracy, I end discovery-oriented
conversations with the question, “Who else should I talk to about this
issue?” Independent of the content or the quality of the content, this
question is the entry point to a large second-order social network of
expertise that is often separate from the hierarchical chain of command.
If multiple separate discussions lead to the same person, then that
person is key.</p>
<p>Documenting your process as you proceed helps both your
self-reflection and your ability to measure progress. Written
documentation of your status can be used as proactive updates to your
management and provides a record when someone asks retroactively why you
took certain actions.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic challenges that do not violate the constraints of Nature
(such as conservation of momentum, conservation of mass, speed of light,
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg
Uncertainty principle</a>) are solvable. There are typically political,
social, personality, security, and technical aspects that need to be
accounted for. Laws can be changed, regulations altered, people
replaced, and norms updated. Constraints that appear to be logically
inconsistent may be re-framed to be resolved. Narrowing or broadening
the scope may reset the context for a challenge.</p>
<h2 id="setting-your-emotional-state">Setting Your Emotional State</h2>
<p>As a member of a bureaucratic organization, you may feel the
frustration of bureaucracy, the happiness of success, the excitement of
possibilities, or the fear of uncertainty of operating in a complicated
environment. Your emotional state, whether set by your work or set by
events outside the bureaucracy, impacts your productivity and the
well-being of your coworkers.</p>
<p>You may see emotions as getting in the way of productivity and
creating problems, or emotions as unprofessional. This view is not
shared by everyone, and there are real benefits to feelings like
passion, enthusiasm, excitement, and joy. Yes, joy can be felt by
bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Expecting bureaucrats to be apply cold rational logic to decisions
and interactions is unrealistic. Openness to engaging emotional is more
constructive than avoiding or suppressing emotional aspects of the
job.</p>
<p>One source of emotions inspired by bureaucracy is when your roles,
responsibilities, and resources do not align. You want to be effective
and feel frustrated. This frustration can infect your interactions with
coworkers.</p>
<p>Another source of emotions in a bureaucratic organization is when you
see someone else making what appears to be a poor decision or policy. If
you lack the ability to alter the decision or influence the policy, this
can feel disheartening or demoralizing. Worse, these policies outside
your control may impact you.</p>
<p>A third set of emotions in bureaucratic interactions occurs when a
group of bureaucrats with distinct perspectives, strong opinions, and
diverse experiences faced with complex challenges have insufficient time
to create consensus and select the optimal choice. Stress felt by each
participant impacts the interaction.</p>
<p>The relevance of these emotional states is that frustration and
stress can decrease your capacity for effective communication. Happier
bureaucrats can be more productive and collaborative.</p>
<p>By identifying these emotional patterns, the situation can seem less
personal. Your feelings are legitimate, but they are not unique to you.
Anyone in that situation is likely to feel similarly. Realizing this
helps build empathy instead of ignoring the feeling.</p>

Making progress in a bureaucracy is not a linear sequence of steps.
Ideally there is an on-going cycle of trying something, not succeeding,
and then applying what you learn towards the next try. This idealized
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast#Business">fail
fast</a>” cycle does not occur naturally – the participants have to
either have intrinsic motivation or external incentives to make
progress. Failing as a path for learning is justified after having
exhausted less expensive alternative education opportunities like
reading books, going to school, and talking with experts.</p>
<p>The recognition of failure depends on a clear measurement. Do the
participants know the measure, and are they able to make the
measurement? Having a defined measure of failure and regularly making
the measurement relies on having an understanding of the expectations
for the situation. Expectations are assumptions about the future.</p>
<p>Assumptions about the future can be categorized as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Opinions. For example, interpretation of policy. Policy
interpretation can be bent or exceptions can be made.</p></li>
<li><p>Guesses; more formally interpolation – given multiple options,
this seems most likely.</p></li>
<li><p>Experience; more formally extrapolation – last time this
happened, so next time ...</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Failure with respect to expectations imply thinking about the future
so that you can measure your progress (or failure). That is a subset of
planning. You can fail if you don’t plan, and you can fail if you do
plan. This does not indicate that planning is irrelevant. Plans can be
overly detailed and prescriptive, or plans can be inadequately
specified; both are unhelpful.</p>
<p>If your measurements indicate failure, this could be due to an
invalid assumption (with a valid objective) or you may have selected a
bad objective. Declaring failure means re-evaluating assumptions,
resetting objectives, or giving up on the concept and doing something
else.</p>
<p> <br />
There are ways to avoid failing: by not setting an objective, or setting
an objective that isn’t measurable. You can avoid the appearance of
failure by not telling anyone the objective. Extrinsic accountability
for failure requires other people to have awareness. If these tactics
are being employed, it may be because the person (or</p>
<p><a href="#sec:org-failure-and-success">the organization</a>) doesn’t
want to share how they’ve failed until they have a success.</p>
<p>Understanding rationales like the failure avoidance mentality is
critical if you want to avoid feeling baffled the first time you
encounter it. By learning these bureaucratic anti-patterns, you can
inoculate yourself emotionally and cognitively. You now have a chance to
think ahead before encountering the explanation.</p>
<p>A counterargument when you hear that someone is avoiding failure is
to explain that noticing failure is essential to improving. Detecting
indicators of failure, addressing the cause, and then changing is the
process of improvement. When someone wants to avoid failure, I don’t
understand how they expect to improve.</p>
<h2 id="success-and-failure-in-your-organization">Success (and failure)
in Your Organization<span id="sec:org-failure-and-success"
label="sec:org-failure-and-success"></span></h2>
<p>This section on how a team or organization conceptualizes failure is
separate from <a href="#sec:learn-from-failure">learning from
failure</a> as an individual bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Understanding the ways your organization succeeds or fails matters to
you because it affects how you are evaluated and how you feel about your
work. Success and failure are measured with respect to a quantitative
objective.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations have varying definitions of success and
failure because organizations are made up of individual bureaucrats with
a multitude of motives and weak feedback mechanisms. There are a few
macro-level patterns for organizations. Each pattern has affect on the
individual bureaucrats operating within the organization.</p>
<p> <br />
A bureaucratic organization that provides infrastructure service (such
as public water utility, electrical power company, or an organization’s
internal computer support) has a specific failure mode. When
infrastructure is unavailable or degraded, that’s a failure. Success
means satisfactory operation at minimal cost. An organization operating
in this context is motivated to avoid failure. Success is merely a lack
of failure. An effort to improve processes or otherwise innovate will
face the inertia of a culture organized around avoiding failure.</p>
<p> <br />
A bureaucratic organization that claims “wins” but no failures (because
either more or different work needed) is difficult to be productive in
when the successful outcome has ill-defined value. The success can be
counted (number of wins), but the relative importance of the success is
unclear.</p>
<p>Examples of a win-focused organization include law enforcement,
research teams, and teams with a responsibility for innovation.</p>
<p>The funding for an organization focused on “wins” depends on how well
these successes can be sold as a narrative. This biases the organization
to focus on investments most likely to get more funding. Have the
funding organization is separate from the consumer of the “wins” yields
outcomes not helpful to the consumer.</p>
<p> <br />
</p>
<h2 id="promotion">Promotion<span id="sec:promotion"
label="sec:promotion"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucrats get promoted for multiple reasons: due to their technical
competence (a bad reason) or their managerial ability (a good
reason).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_principle">Dilbert
principle</a> says organizations “Systematically promote incompetent
employees to management to get them out of the workflow.” That
observation is a post-hoc rationalization for managers with no apparent
management skills and a lack of technical skills.</p>
<p>A similar-in-spirit observation is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putt%27s_Law_and_the_Successful_Technocrat">Putt’s
Law</a> which says “<del>Technology</del>[Bureaucracy] is dominated by
two types of people, those who understand what they do not manage and
those who manage what they do not understand."</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle">Peter
principle</a> : “People in a hierarchy tend to rise to ‘a level of
respective incompetence’: employees are promoted based on their success
in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer
competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to
another.”</p>
<p>This might manifest as recurring failure. More likely, your
incompetence will blind you to your own failures.</p>
<p>To avoid falling victim to the Peter principal, do not promote unless
the employee has a track record of performing at the next promotion
level. The downside is that the employee is working at a discounted rate
since they are providing value beyond what is expected of their
grade.</p>
<p>The Peter principal <span class="citation"
data-cites="1970_Peter">(Peter 1970)</span> has an element of truth,
especially when a person starts a new role. However, a person can learn
their role and become competent. Also, the Peter principles relies on
the simplification of a single dimension of intelligence. See <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences">Gardner’s
theory of multiple intelligences</a>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="promotion-selects-values">Promotion Selects
Values</h3>
<p>Promotion is a critical aspect of designing incentives for behavior.
Promotion is central because there are a variety of motives – for money,
for status, for authority.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="promotion-of-individuals">Promotion of
Individuals</h3>
<p>Promotion typically focuses on the successes of a person. This
deemphasizes teamwork and lessons learned from failures. Promotion of a
person (rather than the team) results in hero culture.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="promotion-and-risk">Promotion and Risk</h3>
<p>Lowering the value of learning from failures increases risk aversion.
The risk tolerance of a bureaucratic organization is driven in part by
tensions in the promotion processes: an interest in success (more
success is better) and avoidance of failure. This imbalance can lead
seeking ownership of efforts that are likely to succeed, seeking easier
successes, and afterwards stealing credit for outcomes created by other
people.</p>
<p> <br />
What is preventing innovation is lack of risk taking. Actual risk means
potential for failure. fear of failure because culture avoids failure
due to concerns of waste. Also, anyone who fails can use this argument,
but that isn’t the same as “fail fast” because what’s critical is
learning from failure and sharing that insight gained so other’s don’t
need to repeat.</p>
<p>There are two options for learning: your own mistakes, or the
mistakes of others. Formal education is about the latter.</p>
<h4 id="organization-chart-orientation">Organization chart orientation
<span id="sec:org-chart-orientation"
label="sec:org-chart-orientation"></span></h4>
<p>A common method of describing relations within the bureaucracy is the
organization chart (colloquially, the “<span
data-acronym-label="org chart" data-acronym-form="singular+short">org
chart</span>"). Normally the CEO is at the top of the chart, middle
management is in the middle, and managed employees are at the bottom.
See figure <a href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top">5.1</a></p>
<p>An organization’s culture is subtly conveyed by artifacts like org
charts. There are emotional connotations to alternative layouts. You can
alter expected relations (culture and norms) by playing with orientation
of the org chart. Org chart orientation can be overanalyzed, so this
exploration is limited.</p>
<p>The point of thinking about org chart orientation is to frame how you
perceive your supervisors, peers, subordinates. Notice that the framing
is embedded in the words – prefixes super (over) and sub (under). These
concepts inform what you expect from relations. Do I seek support or
direction and guidance from my boss? What do I expect from my boss,
peers subordinates? What do I expect to provide them?</p>
<p>The relative orientation of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> to
workers sets expectations for relations. Options for orientation are the
conventional CEO at top (figure <a
href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top">5.1</a>), CEO at the
bottom (figure <a href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-bottom"

the right (figure <a href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-leads"

<p>This section focuses on an individual bureaucrat operating within an
organization. What actions can you take? This is a prelude to <a
href="#sec:working-with-other-bureaucrats">working with others</a>.</p>
<p>Understanding your options as a bureaucrat for action matters because
trying to withdraw from bureaucracy isn’t harmless. There is no neutral
member of a bureaucracy. Either you are contributing to the
organization, or you are sapping resources from the organization. This
is because the organization operates in a zero-sum game for resource
allocation.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-for-innovation-within-a-bureaucracy">Ideas for Innovation
within a Bureaucracy<span id="sec:innovation"
label="sec:innovation"></span></h2>
<p>As a bureaucrat in an organization, you will see deficiencies and
challenges. You could ignore the issues, complain but not take action,
work around (avoid) the issues, or try to improve your organization.
This section focuses on the last option.</p>
<p>Sometimes the issue and the apparent fix seem straightforward. If the
situation has persisted for a long time, consider why the conditions
have remained as is. Instead of framing your idea with, “Isn’t it
obvious that things would be better if ..." learn why what seems obvious
doesn’t happen. Learn the history. Talk to participants. If there is
agreement that the situation is harmful, why has no one else tackled it?
If previous attempts to innovate were tried and failed, why did they
fail? What is novel about your innovation?</p>
<p>If you understand the conditions creating a challenge, and the
history of why other approaches failed, and you have an innovative
response, consider the stakeholders. Innovation is necessarily
disruptive to incumbent processes and teams and social power. Do the
incumbents benefit from the proposed innovation? Have they said they
will benefit, or are you projecting their response? Innovation that
benefits the organization but harms incumbents is less likely to
succeed.</p>
<p>In addition to the social hurdles, innovation requires taking risks
(otherwise the effort is merely incremental improvement). Risk in an
organization means losing time or resources, potential harm to
reputation, legal consequences.</p>
<p>Once you decide to innovate, and after you’ve learned the history and
talked to participants, you have choices about how to innovate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Innovate while ignoring the bureaucracy. Your scope is limited to
what you can accomplish alone. Integration is tough and causes
frustration.</p></li>
<li><p>Fight to create a space free from bureaucracy to enable
innovation. You’ve intentionally isolated innovators from resources
present in the organization, and integration back into the org is now
more challenging.</p></li>
<li><p>Leverage existing hierarchy and processes. Can be frustrating to
work with bureaucrats who are not as focused as you are.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A recap of the innovation lifecycle in a bureaucracy:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You see problems and challenges in your environment. This
manifests as complaints from both the people directly harmed and
observers who see inefficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>You share ideas for innovation and gets feedback. Build a
coalition of people willing to fight for the idea on your behalf so that
when you’re not present, the idea is still proceeding towards
implementation. That puts the threshold at “so important other people
are willing to pause whatever they were working on and take up your
cause.”</p></li>
<li><p>Enacting these suggestions require either a change to existing
processes or new processes or an investment of work. These changes may
not succeed – there’s risk. Your idea could fail because it’s not a good
idea. It could also fail because someone doesn’t like you, or the idea
doesn’t account for some dependency you weren’t aware of, or it might
conflict with other changes in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do decide to invest effort, the activity takes you away
from your current work. Enacting the change might involve skills you
don’t have; learning those skills takes time. Carrying out the activity
with new skills increases the likelihood of novice mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>If someone else enacts the idea they get the credit for having
done the work.</p></li>
<li><p>If the idea saves money or time, there’s typically no monetary
reward. Recognition and benefit to your reputation isn’t required as
part of the change process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are many barriers in that lifecycle. The problem has to be
observable to someone willing to invest effort in change. That person
has to build a coalition of stakeholders. If the person isn’t negatively
harmed, that person may also lack clear benefit from resolving
inefficiency.</p>
<p> <br />
In addition to the work of enacting the change, there is an
administrative overhead of documenting the reason for the change.
Subjective decisions mean choices have to be defensible. The need for
defensible justifications result in conservative decisions and risk
aversion and a decrease of motive for innovation.</p>
<p> <br />
Don’t bother buying new technology because there’s a lot of risk and we
already know how to use the existing technology. (Same applies to
innovation with policies.)</p>
<p>The people in decision making positions in the hierarchy have more
experience with existing technology and are therefore biased against
novel technology. Also, getting burned a few times on innovation makes
people more conservative.</p>
<p>With limited time and staff available within the organization,
experienced decision makers are typically not on the bleeding edge of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">hype
cycle</a>.</p>
<p>These barriers lead to external observers to conclude something like
the following simplification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats
hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better
results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top
of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept?<a href="#fn41"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="changing-your-environment">Changing your
Environment</h3>
<p>Changing the bureaucratic organization you are a member of is
difficult. That applies regardless of your motive for change and the
thing to be changed. Regardless of motive, there are tactics applicable
to any change. The two major categories of change are <a
href="#sec:change-a-process">processes</a> (e.g., technical solutions,
changing policy)</p>
<p>and changing the <span data-acronym-label="culture"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">culture</span> of the members of an
organization.</p>
<p> <br />
Culture is the set of norms that determine acceptable behavior for
members of the organization. Norms come from the expectations of your
fellow bureaucrats. Your coworkers can model desired behavior and
inflict punishments for deviations from norms. The culture of the
organization is practiced by members.</p>
<p>The expectations of culture should be stated explicitly. If the
explicitly stated norms are in conflict with what is experienced by the
organization’s members the hypocrisy decimates trust.</p>
<p>Besides modeling desired norms in the organization, there are a few
more tactics you can take. Reinforce positive examples of desired
behavior with public praise and meaningful rewards. Punish examples of
undesirable norms.</p>
<p>Altering cultural norms of a bureaucratic organization means altering
member behavior, adjusting incentives to re-enforce the desired
behavior, punish undesirable behavior, and provide resources to make the
intended outcomes easier.</p>
<p>Although aspects of culture may be problematic, thinking of cultural
change as problem solving is not a useful framing. Bureaucrats don’t
solve problems, they address challenges. The word “problem" implies
solution. The problem-solution framing is inaccurate in a bureaucracy
since altering the situation merely introduces novel challenges. Even
though you don’t solve a challenge, you can still get a sense of
emotional reward from having improved the situation.</p>
<p> <br />
Prior to investing effort in change, reflect on the emotional and career
impact of your effort. Will the work bring you joy, or is your emotional
reward tied to the outcome? If the outcome is the only source of reward,
you’ll either be disappointed in failure or you will be more
conservative (intending to increase the likelihood of success). The work
of creating positive change can be joyful: you can form relationships
and focus on learning.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of change in a bureaucratic organization is
figuring out what is worth changing. There are many opportunities for
improvement. Talk to stakeholders and enumerate their challenges. From
the myriad stories, identify recurring themes and root causes. Typically
bureaucratic challenges intertwine technical, budget, staffing,
historical context, personalities of participants, and organizational
politics.</p>
<p>Select an aspect that you have some competence in and allows for
growth. If the challenge is big (many people involved, takes a long
time, cost a lot) can it be broken down into incremental challenges?
Distinguish wide-scale changes from local changes over which you have
more influence.</p>
<p>Having surveyed challenges worth addressing and picked something, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence">Chesterton’s
fence</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing
state of affairs is understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Talking to stakeholders in the survey phase may yield tidbits of
history. Why have previous efforts been rejected or not taken effect?
Written documentation of the history should be augmented by oral
folklore.</p>
<p>If your idea has a novel justification for success, identify all
possible methods of progress and then rank the tasks. If you can’t do
all the work, who can you collaborate with? Can you delegate to people
with skills you lack, or will you have to gain new skills? If no one has
the relevant skills, becoming the widely-acknowledged expert gains
power.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="creating-change-in-the-organization">Creating
Change in the Organization<span id="sec:creating-change"
label="sec:creating-change"></span></h3>
<p>If the organization you are in has no problems or challenges, this
section can be skipped. For bureaucrats in organizations that do have
issues, this part of the guidebook provides points to ponder independent
of the specific problem.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you have unique insight on the challenges the
organization faces, and you have unique leverage to alter the situation.
While you could proceed haphazardly, an effective bureaucrat has vision.
The vision is a story of what-could-be. This vision can be broken out as
goals: specific measurable outcomes. Each goal requires contingency
plans for achieving the goal. Plans are marked milestones which indicate
whether the plan is proceeding successfully.</p>
<p>Perspectives to consider when assessing change include what the
situation is, what the situation could be, and what the situation looks
like for different stakeholders. Each person has different information,
a different way of responding to issues, and shifting intents.</p>
<p>People who you depend on who have conflicting visions or no vision,
confounding your ability to improve the organization. There are
different views on whether something is actually a problem, distinct
characterizations of an issue, and competing priorities.</p>
<p>A trade-off to consider is that having niche impact is easier than
broad change (the <a href="#table:scope-broad-vs-narrow">Dilemma of
Scope of Effect</a>). There’s also a trade-off of the quick fix versus
more robust solutions (the <a href="#table:quick-methodical">Dilemma of
Speed and Accuracy</a>).</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Understand and empathize with the fear of change.<br />
When faced with a challenge, the options are to take action or to not
take action. If you take action, the options are failure, success, or
iteration. The choice of no action is attractive if you are not
suffering. Delay minimizes work, enables beneficial moves since the
player can wait out other players, and there are other things to focus
on.</p>
<p>Action incurs risk due to uncertainty and costs work to create
change.</p>
<p>Fear of failure is justified if and only if the cost of the failure
is greater than the value of lessons learned.</p>
<p>Fear of iteration is a fear that the process might be stopped
prematurely – before perfection.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Before starting a new effort, check to see whether this
has been tackled before. Learn the history of the problem. Why hasn’t
this been solved?</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Query your first and second order social network.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Get feedback early before polishing.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Advertise the result.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Hear criticism and respond.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Leverage both social networks and bureaucratic
processes.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Identify sources of power (hierarchical positions and
titles, social influence, reputation and credibility, buzzphrases or
popular paradigms) and leverage them.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Professional respect (for what the other person knows) and
professional curiosity (for what you don’t know)<br />
Example: Getting approval from multiple overseers in different
hierarchies is hard. Often different objectives and incentives.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Use social recommendations to name relevant
individuals.<br />
Leverage the trust already in an existing social network by starting
with “Person A recommended I talk to you about X."</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Sit in on meetings, listen to topics, see who is talking,
who is attending. After the meeting talk to individuals about the
meeting. Set up one-on-one informal discussions. Keep the first
conversation brief - 10 or 15 minutes. Your body language should
indicate engagement and interest. “Who else would you recommend talking
to?" is the last question in the first conversation.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip</em>: Consensus doesn’t mean everyone agrees on the problem, the
remedy, or the approach, or who’s taking the action. Consensus in a
bureaucracy means people aren’t going to resist the change.</p>
<h2 id="measuring-bureaucratic-maturity">Measuring Bureaucratic
Maturity</h2>
<p>Bureaucratic maturity of bureaucrats in an organization can be broken
into three behaviors: complaining, seeing opportunity, and finding <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudges</a>.</p>
<p>The first and most wide spread behavior is to see a problem and then
complain about the situation. This indicates awareness of the
environment but no creativity regarding what to do about the
problems.</p>
<p>The second, less common behavior, is to see a problem and recognize
the situation as an opportunity. This requires creativity and
reframing.</p>
<p>The third behavior is to see a problem and then <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudge</a> the
situation towards a vision. The nudges could be through either direct
action or by influencing others.</p>
<p> <br />
An individual bureaucrat can show one or more of these behaviors. That
is, being capable of the third behavior does not mean the person lacks
the ability to complain on other topics.</p>
<p>There is not a specific amount of experience within the organization
needed to arrive at any of these three paradigms. A holistic
understanding of the system certainly helps.</p>
<p>The “vision" of the third behavior could be in the form of a
long-term (temporally distant) outcome, or the vision could be of
immediate multi-party cooperation.</p>
<h1 id="working-with-other-bureaucrats">Working with other
Bureaucrats<span id="sec:working-with-other-bureaucrats"
label="sec:working-with-other-bureaucrats"></span></h1>
<p>You were hired to do a job. That job relies on technical skills
you’ve accumulated through education and experience. Now you’re a member
of team. You’ll need to interact with other bureaucrats for a variety of
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Delegation of tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking for help.</p></li>
<li><p>Seeking input.</p></li>
<li><p>Offering help.</p></li>
<li><p>Offering input.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While that generic observation sounds reasonable, in practice you
encounter significant friction in getting things done. If everyone
participating in a process thinks they are doing the right thing, then
why are there suboptimal outcomes? Potential reasons include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each participant in the process may have limited view of other
parts of the process. Each person talks to only to adjacent
participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Each participant typically has limited scope of responsibility.
They don’t need to know everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Each participant typically has limited scope of authority. Even
if the person knows more than just their role, they lack control over
other aspects of the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants typically have insufficient time, resources, and
expertise to enact improvements.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants in the process may have a common goal, but different
methods for addressing the challenges.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all potential constraints; they don’t exclude being
effective or improving the process. You can learn what someone else’s
priorities are and why those are priorities.</p>
<p>Solo work may be more emotionally rewarding due to fewer external
constraints, but the cost is complexity and scope being limited to the
skills of the individual.</p>
<p>When you can’t do everything yourself, you rely on your team and
members of the wider organization. You can treat this loss of
independence within the organization (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation">deindividuation</a>)
as either sublimation (and feel suffocated) or an extension of your
capacity and abilities (and feel empowered).</p>
<p>Working with others allows you to occasionally accomplish complex
results beyond your own skills or your own bandwidth in spite of
collaborators not being under your control. How? Through persuasion.</p>
<p>The challenge of collaboration is to multiply productivity rather
than merely sum the output of a set of individuals.</p>
<p>Inside an organization, cooperation/coordination is not held together
by internal contracts or even <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">service
level agreements</a>. What holds the organization together? Force of
will of participants.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-value-you-provide-fellow-bureaucrats">The
Value You provide fellow Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>When you engage fellow bureaucrats as part of a process, you are
providing your time, attention, and alertness. To illustrate the
relevance of those aspects, consider the following. I can talk to you
for 15 minutes of time, but if your attention is directed towards your
phone, then you’re not fully engaged with me. If you are paying
attention during the time we have together but you haven’t slept for 36
hours, then your alertness may not be 100%.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-of-bureaucrats">Motivation of Bureaucrats<span
id="sec:motivations" label="sec:motivations"></span></h2>
<p>Appreciating the diverse motives of the bureaucrats you work with is
instructive. If you expect everyone to have the same motives as you then
you will be surprised by the friction created by diverse motives.</p>
<p>Motivations of participants are rarely “how can I make the
organization more successful" or even “how can I sell or produce more
product"? Usually motivation is based on personal success in various
manifestations, which leads to emergent phenomena which appears
confounding to observers outside the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Each bureaucrat has a motive, even the bureaucrats who do nothing. In
an organization where you are a paid bureaucrat, you are either actively
working for improvement of the organization, or your existence is
parasitic to the organization. There is no “idle" status for paid
employees in an organization with limited resources.</p>
<p>As an example motive for a bureaucrat, I want to avoid being too
efficient such that I eliminate the need for my job, and not so
inefficient that the organization fails and I lose my job. Increasing
the efficiency of bureaucracy is good for the organization and the
outcomes, but can be harmful to the bureaucrat’s career.</p>
<p>Career stability within an organization is a benefit, and it can be
leveraged to take more risk. However, it typically manifests as inaction
by an employee. There’s no harm to the employee in not taking action. If
an employee doesn’t do anything, nothing bad will happen to that
employee. Career stability decreases extrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>Example motivations for bureaucrats: stability (aka job security, the
comfort of a routine), money (current pay or future earnings), travel,
problem solving, status, exerting power or control, credibility of being
associated with the organization (if the organization has a positive
reputation), logistical convenience (“the office is near where I
lived”), service to people the organization serves.</p>
<p>The consequence of diverse motives is that expecting bureaucratic
organizations to be logical, fair, consistent, and efficient is
unreasonable even when every participant wants those features. Each
bureaucrat thinks, “I am logical, fair, consistent, and efficient.”
Therefore each bureaucrat expects other bureaucrats to meet those same
(unrealistic) standards. Next, anthropomorphize the team or organization
and expect the group to meet those standards.</p>
<p>Even if each bureaucrat were logical, fair, consistent, and efficient
(they are not, and neither are you), each person has a different
motivation. Each person wants to accomplish something different using
their unique skills and referencing their own experiences. Compounding
the confusion, each bureaucrat has to coordinate using communication
that has latency and limited bandwidth and isn’t precise.</p>
<p>An expectation that bureaucracy feels illogical, unfair,
inconsistent, and inefficient is a useful baseline. Working against
bureaucratic entropy yields improvements even though perfection is
inaccessible.</p>
<h2 id="bureaucratic-tropes">Bureaucratic Tropes<span id="sec:tropes"
label="sec:tropes"></span></h2>
<p>Any sufficiently large organization will have a diverse group of
bureaucrats. From that diversity certain tropes emerge. The value of
recognizing these recurring patterns is to leverage their strengths so
that you and that person can be more effective.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Excited intern or new employee.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Their enthusiasm can be channeled to take on
challenges other bureaucrats are scared of taking on for political
reasons. Their naivete should be remedied by pairing with a mentor who
can explain the history of the organization and specific
challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>Retired in place.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Recognizing this attitude allows you to temper
your own expectations about their productivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Font of institutional memory. Likes to explain how the current
situation relates to his experience 10 years ago.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can benefit from talking to this person
about historical processes and what has been tried before.</p></li>
<li><p>“Let them eat cake” managers who are removed from challenges and
deny the problem is a problem.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: It is worth figuring out whether these
managers actually don’t care, or if they are busy fighting battles you
are not exposed to.</p></li>
<li><p>“Don’t rock the boat” people who tried changing the system,
didn’t succeed, and are emotionally beaten down such that they no longer
try.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: These people are often creative and can be
consulted before you tackle a challenge they have experience
with.</p></li>
<li><p>The Patriot who is willing to sacrifice for the
organization.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Educate them that there are alternative ways
to be effective in a bureaucracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Mismatched – person’s skills and interests don’t match their
role, so they are despondent and frustrated.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can provide value to this person by
networking with them and finding better opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>Friendly grouch: friendly and helpful but unhappy in their job
due to bureaucracy and other hurdles.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Provide a copy of this book to increase their
effectiveness and improve their spirits. They will be grateful to you
and the organization will benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>Detail-oriented: ask them what time it is and they’ll tell you
how to build a clock.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can serve as their ambassador to other
members of the team or organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above personality tropes apply to individuals. If your team works
on multiple projects, you may identify project tropes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We’ve always done it this way.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: The team is scared of change. This change may be
known (and be undesirable) or unknown. Change disrupts power.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can brainstorm with the team ways to
incrementally improve.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual solutions to systemic challenges.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Demonstrating small wins helps build
credibility.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Plan to ramp up in complexity (towards the
systemic challenges) and spend the earned reputation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not every bureaucrat response to challenges the same way.
Understanding the diversity of potential reactions (or inaction) before
you encounter them decreases the surprise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Solve the problem. This is the engineering approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a simpler problem. This is the Physics approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a more abstract problem. This is the Mathematical
approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a different problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize and ignore the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>What problem?</p></li>
<li><p>Assign someone else the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Redefine the problem so that it is already solved. “That’s not a
problem, that’s how it’s supposed to work.”</p></li>
<li><p>Apply for resources (staff, training, money) to solve the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Point to the problem as a justification for more
resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Give a talk about the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a paper about the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach a course on the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk to your therapist about the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Your manager declares the problem solved and gets a
bonus.</p></li>
<li><p>Reframe the problem as an opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>Study the problem in the context of the broader system.</p></li>
<li><p>Study the problem from other people’s perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the impact of the problem on the broader system.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a set of activities for role playing parts of the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve part of the problem. Then another part.</p></li>
<li><p>Research whether anyone else worked on the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Find other instances of the problem that were already
solved.</p></li>
<li><p>Find similar problems and identify the differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Contract out the solution and select a bid.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why the problem does not need to be solved.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why the problem is beneficial.</p></li>
<li><p>Form a team and set a mission statement addressing the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Slow-roll the problem until you don’t need to worry about the
problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Did you recognize any of those responses from your own past
experiences? Were any unexpected?</p>
<h2 id="not-my-job-task-scope">Not my Job: Task Scope</h2>
<p>If I ask someone for help on a task that benefits our team, that
person might respond that the task is “not my job" and time spent on
tasks like that “gets in the way" of their progress. The interesting
(emotionally rewarding) work is not that task.</p>
<p>‘<a
href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scut">Scut</a>’ is
medical slang for the non-clinical yet essential tasks that do not
require a doctor’s degree or expertise. This is different from
administrivia (administrative tasks).</p>
<p>“Once I realized someone else has the same problem, I stopped
worrying about it.” Same as “not my job."</p>
<p>The potential reasons for this reluctance to help include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Working on the task will not get them promoted.</p></li>
<li><p>Their understanding of the scope of their job and their expertise
does not include the task.</p></li>
<li><p>The person don’t know how to do the task and they don’t want to
learn.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, progress for the individual is not aligned with the
success of the team.</p>
<h2 id="building-managing-and-spending-reputation">Building, Managing,
and Spending Reputation<span id="sec:reputation"
label="sec:reputation"></span></h2>
<p>This section is about actions you can take to create a reputation.
Even if you don’t intentionally build a reputation you still get one.
Also in this section: how to spend political capital – both your own and
that of your team.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="relevance-of-reputation-in-a-bureaucracy">Relevance of Reputation in
a Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>As a bureaucrat you may want to be all things to all people. Since
that is not feasible, you have to limit your scope and therefore
disappoint some people. This same dynamic of a limited scope applies to
the team you are on, and again to the organization the team is part of.
The purpose of a bureaucratic team or bureaucratic organization is to
manage a shared resource for a constituency. The constituency will
invariably be disappointed.</p>
<p>The good news is that you have influence over how others perceive
your limitations. Investing in relationships and conducting creative
negotiation with other bureaucrats, other teams, and other organizations
shape their perception of your value.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="definition-of-reputation">Definition of
Reputation</h3>
<p>Your <span data-acronym-label="reputation"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">reputation</span> as a bureaucrat is
what other people expect from you. Reputation is perception. What does
that person think of you? Your team? Your organization? Reputation is
set whenever and where ever you are observed, or artifacts are
associated with you. What you wear matters to how you are perceived.
When you show up impacts your reputation. How your written communication
is read alters perceptions. People are informed by your body posture in
meetings.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="reputation-brand-image">Reputation, Brand,
Image</h3>
<p>There are multiple phrases that all refer to the same concept of
being perceived and the associated expectations. Individuals create (or
get) a reputation; organizations have brands. A team of bureaucrats can
have a reputation.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="your-reputation-matters">Your Reputation
matters</h3>
<p>Your personal reputation within the organization dramatically impacts
your effectiveness. People will let you do things (or prevent you from
doing things) based on their expectations about you.</p>
<p>Your reputation matters impacts your influence. Whether other people
turn to you for input depends on what they expect from you. How other
people perceive you impacts what you can accomplish and when people seek
out your help or input.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="you-can-manage-your-reputation">You can
Manage your Reputation</h3>
<p>Managing reputation means acknowledging that your interaction with
others is partially performative. This may feel disappointing if you
want to be judged solely on your productivity or knowledge.</p>
<p>Your success is limited if you focus exclusively on doing the work,
and your success is limited if you focus exclusively on the performative
aspects. Neglecting to manage your reputation means you lose input to
the stories others tell about you. Active management of your reputation
requires engaging people and generating evidence.</p>
<p>Your reputation is dynamically changing based on your activities and
communication. Your communication matters, and the stories other people
tell about you matter.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="techniques-for-building-reputational-capital">Techniques for
Building Reputational Capital</h3>
<p>Ideally your reputation would be based on your technical skills, your
ability to collaborate with other people, the strength of your network,
and your creativity. None of those matters if the person you’re engaging
with doesn’t know those things. You build reputation by doing things
that are useful and visible to other people. This positive association
is what you are creating.</p>
<p>Because the definition of reputation is about expectations other
people have about you, what you choose to work on matters. How you work
on your tasks (creativity, enthusiasm, dedication), the artifacts
produced, and your ability to communicate all shape your reputation.</p>
<p>When building reputation, you can work on multiple small wins or take
larger risk on bigger bets. The bigger bets provide faster leverage of
reputational capital as you have demonstrated your worthiness and
skill.</p>
<p>The same concepts apply to teams of bureaucrats and bureaucratic
organizations. Just as individuals compete for resources, teams compete
for budget, staffing, and glory. How the team’s budget and staffing are
spent impact reputation.</p>
<p>A specific technique for building a good reputation is to give <a
href="#sec:credit-others">credit to others</a>. This may seem
counter-intuitive if you are focused on the apparent assignment of
credit. What actually matters is that other people observe you (whether
directly or indirectly) giving credit.</p>
<p>Similarly, another technique for building good reputation is offering
to <a href="#sec:take-blame">take blame</a>. Again, this can seem
counter-intuitive since being blamed doesn’t sound good. The value is in
proclaiming your willingness to be blamed such that other people observe
your offer.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="using-good-news-or-early-news-to-build-influence">Using Good News
(or Early News) to build Influence</h3>
<p>Rather than tell good news directly to a top-level decision maker,
first inform the person who influences the decision maker. I tell the
influencer the information does not need to be credited to me.</p>
<p>The benefits of this approach include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improves the influencer’s reputation with the decision
maker.</p></li>
<li><p>The influencer has the chance to contextualize the information
for the decision maker.</p></li>
<li><p>The influencer has the option to leverage the information in ways
I would not have.</p></li>
<li><p>My reputation with the influencer is enhanced.</p></li>
<li><p>I reaffirmed the influencer’s role and status.</p></li>
<li><p>Influencers are easier to access.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-spend-reputation">How to Spend
Reputation</h3>
<p>Based on your reputation (what the other person expects), what trust
does that person have? You can then use that trust to do things that
might not otherwise be feasible. You can spend reputation to bend the
rules.</p>
<p>Reputation is not the only thing you as a bureaucrat can spend. Other
examples include your time (up to you entire career), your ability to be
a member in the team or organization, your self-respect, and your
ability to be promoted or receive bonuses. At the level of the team and
the organization, additional aspects to spend are the budget and the
staff. Each of these (reputation, time, membership, budget, staffing)
are potential investments.</p>
<p>Things I’m not willing to spend: my integrity and my health
(physical, mental, emotional).</p>
<p>Whenever you are engaging within your team, you are either actively
spending or building your reputation within the team. Whenever you are
engaging with people from outside your team, you are either actively
spending or building your team’s reputation. Because of that, spending
reputation means taking risk that involve other people.</p>
<p> <br />
Examples of spending reputation and not getting a return on the
investment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ask for a favors and provide no value.</p></li>
<li><p>Explorer options that other people don’t see as worthwhile and
then there’s no payoff.</p></li>
<li><p>Produce nothing of value to the organization or other
people.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk with people outside your team and misrepresent the efforts
of your team.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking honestly about the faults of your own team to people
outside your team.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="teams-are-subdivisions-of-an-organization">Teams are
Subdivisions of an Organization</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2015_Katzenbach">(Katzenbach and
Smith 2015)</span></p>
<p>In the context of altering teams, there are a few major levers
available: create new team, merge teams, dissolve a team.</p>
<p>For a given set of teams, the lateral interactions are competitive or
cooperative. Coordination is required (or conflict will occur) for
money, staffing, and resources. Examples of resources include access to
or control of data, computer equipment, hardware, floor space, prestige,
products (output).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="roles-of-management-versus-leadership">Roles
of Management versus Leadership</h3>
<p>Teams include managers and leaders. Those roles are not necessarily
the same person.</p>
<p>A manager’s role involves time management, task tracking, employee
evaluations, promotion, pay, requesting resources for team members, and
hiring.</p>
<p>A leader’s role focuses on coordinating vision and principles. The
vision and principles do not have to originate from the leader – other
team members can contribute ideas. The leader’s responsibility is
primarily social consensus.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-empathy">Intellectual Empathy<span
id="sec:intellectual-empathy"
label="sec:intellectual-empathy"></span></h2>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you will work with people who are smarter on a
specific topic than you are. That superior knowledge might come from
experience or from formal education.</p>
<p>The person with superior knowledge may be able to convey their
knowledge to you, or they may struggle to. That struggle could be due to
an inability to break down complex insights, or they don’t recognize the
mismatch between what they know and what you understand. This same
scenario can be reversed – you might be more knowledgeable on a given
topic than some other bureaucrat you work with. In either situation,
both parties have responsibilities of intellectual empathy. The more
knowledgeable person needs to understand what they can build on when
talking with the less knowledgeable person, and the less knowledgeable
person has to be clear about what is making sense and what does not.</p>
<p>I often start conversations with people who are new to me by asking
about their professional background – their education, past work
experience, and other aspects that would allow me to build on their
existing knowledge. This allows me to tailor the conversation to the gap
of knowledge that exists when we are discussing a challenge.</p>
<p>During a conversation you can monitor body language for reactions
like a squint, a head tilt, an eyebrow raise or an eyebrow furrowed.
Those are common reactions when information doesn’t conform to what the
listener was expecting.</p>
<p>A more direct method is to ask about the other person’s knowledge
about the topic. The phrasing “Do you know about (name of topic)?” is
less effective than “What do you know about (name of topic)?”
Respondents might claim experience or knowledge of a topic, but probing
for the difference between “I’ve heard those words before” versus “I was
part of a team that implemented (topic)” versus “I came up with the
original idea for (topic)” is helpful.</p>
<p>Sometimes the person with less knowledge on a topic feels
uncomfortable with indicating their confusion, or sometimes the person
doesn’t realize they are missing the main point. The more knowledgeable
person can check in with the listener to confirm. “What did you get from
what I just talked about?” is a better confirmation than “You understood
what I meant, right?” The person with less knowledge can proactively
check their knowledge by providing a read-back: “Here’s what I
understood you to mean: ...” These check-ins, regardless of who
initiates, should be relatively frequent when exploring complex
topics.</p>
<p>Admitting ignorance can be intimidating and may feel like you risk
losing the other person’s respect. A more gentle way of saying “I’m
lost” is “I was following up until the point where you described ...”
Intellectual empathy is the responsibility of both parties in a
conversation.</p>
<h2 id="leveraging-expertise">Leveraging Expertise<span
id="sec:expertise" label="sec:expertise"></span></h2>
<p>The definition of <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is the management
of shared resources. Besides tangible items like land and water and air,
expertise is another shared resource. Finding people with expertise,
vetting expertise, and deploying expertise are all critical skills for
bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Experts who accumulate knowledge and experience look for ways to
apply their expertise. Finding the right decision makers and providing
relevant context for decisions can feel satisfying when positive impacts
are made.</p>
<p>In the following two sections I describe both viewpoints: that of a
bureaucrat seeking expert help, and that of an expert providing help.
Bridging the cultural and knowledge gap in both directions is necessary
for the success of a society.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="non-experts-seeking-experts">Non-experts
seeking Experts</h3>
<p>Before you seek expert help, your first instinct may be to try and
proceed on your own. Or with help from a peer, or a trusted consultant.
<em>How hard could this be? Looks straightforward...</em></p>
<p>A typical starting point for a challenging decision would be to
collect data and then form a narrative based on that. Surprisingly,
there are bureaucrats who take the opposite view: Don’t measure things;
if you do you’ll be held accountable for them.</p>
<p>Setting aside the avoidance of accountability for a moment, there is
reasoning behind the intent to not measure. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s law</a>
says that “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
measure.” While there are ways to minimize this (e.g., not telling
people what you’re measuring), what you invest in measuring should be
proxies for what the organization values.</p>
<p>If you decide a challenge requires skills you don’t have, anyone with
those skills has more expertise than you. Expertise is relative.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="finding-experts">Finding Experts</h4>
<p>One reason you as a bureaucrat seek an expert is you don’t have
expertise yourself. (If your motivation is merely to seek an external
scapegoat that can be blamed, then getting any expert that appears
convincing will suffice.)</p>
<p>To find a relevantly qualified expert, you can triangulate. Seek
guidance from your existing social network. Multiple referrals from
independent parties are a positive indicator.</p>
<p>Do people defer to the candidate because of the candidate’s title or
position in the hierarchy, the candidate’s experience, or the
candidate’s knowledge of technical details?</p>
<p>Within an area of expertise there may be sub-disciplines that you are
not familiar with. Don’t be embarrassed to ask the expert you find what
subfield they have experience in, and their evaluation of how well that
aligns with the effort you’re recruiting them for.</p>
<p>If you’re tackling a complex challenge, you may need experts from
different disciplines. This introduces added challenges of
cross-discipline communication.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="communicating-with-experts">Communicating
with Experts</h4>
<p>Once you find a candidate expert, you’ll need to evaluate their
expertise and the ability to collaborate. This is inherently difficult
since you lack expertise you are seeking.</p>
<p>When signaled solely by credentials, expertise is independent of
experience. The expert may lack ability to communicate their knowledge
with people outside their domain. A common barrier is use of jargon by
experts.</p>
<p>Jargon can serve two purposes: to signal group membership (harmful to
people outside the group); and to be more precise about a concept
(desirable). An pseudo-expert may use jargon relevant to a topic but not
be able to explain</p>
<p>Levels of expertise:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Self-designated expert is unfamiliar with domain-specific
jargon.</p></li>
<li><p>Pseudo-expert can use jargon in discussion but cannot expand the
definition or provide analogs.</p></li>
<li><p>Pseudo-expert has memorized definitions and has analogies but
doesn’t grasp underlying relations and principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Expert can map situation-of-interest to underlying relations and
principles, then use that mapping to remedy the issue (or explain why a
fix is infeasible). The result works and the solution wasn’t obvious to
non-experts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Experts are cautious to include caveats and limitations.</p>
<p>Does the candidate use the relevant jargon for the topic?</p>
<p>Does the candidate use the jargon for the topic in the right way?</p>
<p>Can the candidate explain the topic with minimal use of jargon?</p>
<p> <br />
</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="what-to-use-an-expert-for">What to use an
Expert For</h4>
<p>Translation process is necessary from “here’s what’s known in
general" + “situation specific facts" to “plan of (in)action" and what’s
realistic with what confidence.</p>
<p>Experts straying outside their expertise are dangerous because the
boundary may not be clear to the audience.</p>

<p>Coherence of data can lead to increased confidence about the results.
Having less data may be more coherent.</p>
<p>More data is likely to be less consistent and therefore lowers
confidence.</p>
<p> <br />
Non-experts think and speak less precisely.</p>
<p>You will need to simplify in the sense of applying to the relevant
decisions - funding, staffing, planning.</p>
<p> <br />
You, the expert, may not win any debates based on number of years of
experience. Some audiences may have many years in the field. However,
expertise (rather than experience) is what they can benefit from.</p>
<p>Identify which party (you, the expert, or the non-expert audience)
has broader diversity of situations.</p>
<p>Respect and account for the expertise of the audience (especially
when they work in a different field). Acknowledge your own limits.</p>
<p>Don’t rely completely on expertise as a single dimensional relation.
Find ways to relate personally to audience members. They will need to
build trust in you personally.</p>
<p>Facilitate the audience setting the goals. They should be able to
identify how success is defined.</p>
<p>Identify strengths your audience has and build on those.</p>
<p>You don’t have to teach a group all-at-once. One-on-one teaching is
more customizable, and the audience may feel less worried about asking
dumb questions.</p>
<p>Once you’ve taught more than one person, they can help each other
translate the skill.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="advice-for-experts">Advice for Experts</h4>
<p>Being the sole subject matter expert in an organization can feel
isolating. You are constantly educating others but the stakeholders are
not expected to become your peers. Typically stakeholders want to know
just enough to make a decision.</p>

<h2 id="does-anyone-want-to-volunteer">Does Anyone Want to
Volunteer?</h2>
<p>The facilitator of a meeting asking, “Does anyone want to volunteer
for this task?" to a group will most often be met by silence. The lack
of engagement can be addressed by not asking for volunteers. The outcome
can be higher engagement with the following tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ask each person whether they are attending to observe or to
volunteer.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person how much time they are willing to volunteer.
Responses could be 0, or 1 hour (non-recurring), or 1 hour per month, or
something else.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what their goals in the interaction are. It is
usually generic (“I want the group to succeed.") but it can be narrow,
in which case that gives you something to focus on.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what they are good at and what skills they have.
Are they good with personal interaction? Writing? Computers?
Coordinating? Logistics? Fund raising? Making phone calls?</p></li>
<li><p>From the inventory of tasks, are there any that fit both the
skills and time? Can the task be scoped to fit the time? If there are
multiple candidate tasks for a volunteer, let them pick the task. (If
there is no existing task that aligns with their skills, do not create
work to be assigned.)</p></li>
<li><p>If there are other volunteer working the same tasks, put them in
contact with the other participants</p></li>
<li><p>Give the volunteer a deadline for the task. The deadline should
not be arbitrary – the deadline should be based on the dependent
follow-on tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that the volunteer is willing to commit the time to
complete the tasks by the deadline</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule a check-in with the volunteer before the task deadline
to review progress</p></li>
<li><p>To create accountability among multiple volunteers, hold a group
review to explain how each participant’s work contributes to the goals
and how work done by one person enables the next task done by someone
else. (Enumerate the dependency graph; include deadlines.)</p></li>

Bureaucracy<span id="sec:communication-within-bureaucracy"

<h2 id="communication-is-critical-for-bureaucracy">Communication is
Critical for Bureaucracy</h2>
<p><span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is a system of
distributed knowledge and distributed decision making. In that context,
the importance of effective communication cannot be overstated. At the
same time, writing and speaking are incomplete and imprecise. This is
why iteration is critical when establishing a shared model.</p>
<p>Relationships matter for communication. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metcalfe’s law</a>
says the value of an organization is proportional to the square of the
number of people interacting in the organization. Broadening your
network of collaborations enables your effectiveness and that of your
fellow bureaucrats.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what is happening in your organization, or you
don’t understand why certain decisions were made, your confusion could
leave you focused on your own self interests since that is what you have
some control over and insight on. This same analysis applies to each
person in the bureaucratic organization. There is a way out of this
harmful cycle: broadcast your intent to other people, be transparent
with decisions, and share the results of your activities. That decreases
the confusion other people may have about you, and if reciprocated can
improve effectiveness.</p>
<p>Feeling saturated with meetings, emails, phone calls, and other
coordination may stem from ineffective communication. Communication that
is incorrect, imprecise, redundant, and insufficient can be improved.
Poor communication yields poor negotiation. Then the interaction
defaults to an emotional struggle of will power.</p>
<p>When a challenge that spans multiple bureaucrats (and may span teams)
is recognized in a bureaucracy, a typical response is to hold more
meetings (ok for decision making) and send more emails (ok for sharing
information). Both these channels are ephemeral. Share information using
channels that are discoverable and durable.</p>
<p>In this book I don’t address paper memos versus email versus phone
calls versus video chat versus Skype versus Slack. The relevant
attributes are agnostic to specific technologies and implementations:
synchronous versus asynchronous; discoverable or not discoverable;
searchable or not searchable.</p>
<p>Communication within a bureaucratic organization occurs on a gradient
of how official the information is. Examples of the gradient ordered
from unofficial to official:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I just made this up and I have no authority</p></li>
<li><p>Based on my experience, ...</p></li>
<li><p>Based on my training, ...</p></li>
<li><p>I heard from someone else (folklore from a peer)</p></li>
<li><p>I heard from someone in a position of authority</p></li>
<li><p>Referencing a written document</p></li>
<li><p>Referencing a written document that looks official</p></li>
<li><p>Referencing a written document that looks official with the
signature of a position of authority</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These indicators convey the relative importance of information for
the bureaucrat.</p>
<p> <br />
Information within a bureaucracy shapes the relationships of
bureaucrats. That spans from not sharing information (which can harm or
protect relationships) to being transparent to being vulnerable. Being
transparent conveys “here’s what is happening." Being vulnerable expands
that to “here’s why that’s happening or what might happen."</p>
<h2 id="why-of-communication-within-a-bureaucracy-matters">Why of
Communication within a Bureaucracy Matters</h2>
<p>Taking action informed by locally-available information can produce

as illustrated by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner’s
dilemma</a>.</p>
<p>Communication among bureaucrats facilitates delegation of work,
allocation of resources, relationship creation/maintenance, and carrying
out processes. Communication has a cost for participants: time spent
building and verifying consensus delays action. There is an opportunity
cost when time is spent talking with people.</p>

<p>Here’s a technique to transform generalizations to action:</p>

<li><p>No one in this organization likes blueberry pie.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t know of anyone in the organization who likes blueberry
pie.</p></li>
<li><p>I like blueberry pie, how would I find someone else in the org
who likes blueberry pie.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the first statement we personify an organization. Organizations
cannot like or dislike tangible items, so this is a meaningless
statement. The second statement is slightly more precise (individual
people can have likes and dislikes) though still a generalization and
therefore likely inaccurate. The source of the generalization might be
your lack of relationships with every member of the organization. That
leads to the fourth statement which is correct, precise, and
curious.</p>
<h2 id="failure-to-communicate">Failure to Communicate<span
id="sec:failure-to-comm" label="sec:failure-to-comm"></span></h2>
<p>Communication is critical in bureaucracy because bureaucracy is a
system of distributed knowledge and distributed decision making. When
less effective communication occurs, individual bureaucrats are less
able to rely on the knowledge of other experts, and they have to make
decisions with less consensus.</p>

Effectiveness in Communication and Some Remedies</h3>
<p><em>Challenge</em>: The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve">Allen curve</a> is an
“exponential drop in frequency of communication between engineers as the
distance between them increases.’</p>
<p>Presence creates priority - go to their desk. I once needed some data
from a coworker. After trying email and phone calls, I ended up flying
across the country. Once I arrived the person was able to provide the
data in a few hours.</p>
<p>Merely sitting next to a coworker, even with no official purpose of
interaction, results in spontaneous informal discussions. See the
discussion of <a href="#sec:prisoner-exchange">Prisoner exchange</a> on
page .</p>
<p>Take advantage of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve">Allen curve</a> by
implementing the Inverse Conway Maneuver. If you know what structure is
needed for a product, then design the placement of your team to reflect
that.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Challenge</em>: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws">Wiio’s law</a>:
“Communication usually fails, except by accident.”<br />
This pessimistic take is similar to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy’s law</a> and
is indicative of the level of ongoing investment needed for effective
communication.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Challenge</em>: Periodic status reports sent up the chain of command
get sanitized so that only good news is shared. This impedes risk
analysis.<br />
If your reports are getting sanitized, as for a copy of the sanitized
version. If you are the person consolidating and aggregating reports,
aim for conciseness rather than good news.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Challenge</em>: Decisions by bureaucrats high in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy">chain of
command</a> are not pushed down the chain.<br />
You can request management provide a summary of their activities.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Challenge</em>: To assume makes an ass out of you and me, yet
assumptions are necessary to making progress in communication.<br />
This dissonance can be addressed by looking for sources of difference
and then talking about them. For example, when I talk with someone for
the first time I ask what their educational background it. If they have
a different degree than mine, I can tune my language to their academic
training. I can make my story more relatable.</p>
<p>Another technique for detecting differences is to ask about the
person’s previous experience. What did they work on previously in this
organization? What were their jobs before joining this organization?
This backstory can provide context for decisions that need to be made in
the current context.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Expose all participants to the consequence of outcomes. In
practice this feels unfair to each participant because the outcome is
partially attributable to other people involved in the process. Dividing
responsibility limits exposure to consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>Have all participants communicate. In practice communication
takes time and skill. Not everyone is willing to invest since
communication is not seen as “doing the work.” Accounting for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve">Allen curve</a> takes
effort. The time needed to arrive through consensus at an optimal
approach for a given situation may exceed time available for solving the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit everything to what can be accomplished by one person. This
hero-based approach is limited to the attention-bandwidth of the person
and their skills. As the complexity increases the necessary skills
increase and the number of candidate heros decreases. Large
organizations accomplish complicated tasks by leveraging diverse
skillsets of teams of bureaucrats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="communication-preferences">Communication Preferences</h2>
<p>There are typically multiple communication channels available between
bureaucrats in an organization. Rather than focus on specific
implementations using specific technologies, consider two variables. The
first variable is asynchronous versus synchronous. Examples of
asynchronous communication channels include voice mail, email, web
forums, web sites, calendars. Synchronous options include phone calls,
video calls, in-person, text-based chat like IRC or Slack. The
distinction between these can be blurry, like if someone immediately
replies to your (asynchronous) email. The second variable is a set of
categories: voice (e.g., phone), text (e.g., website, web forums,
calendars), video (e.g., calls), and in-person.</p>
<p>The lack of equivalence can be seen in comparing text with audio
which has been converted to text. In addition to the text transcription,
voice audio also has inflection, volume, volume variation, rate, rate
variance.</p>
<p>The relevance to a bureaucrat of identifying these channels is to
know which channel is preferred for what purpose. To be an effective
bureaucrat there are reciprocal actions. First, you can list your own
preferences so that people know how best to engage with you. Second, you
can learn and then leverage the preferences of people you collaborate
with.</p>
<p>As an example of knowing your own behaviors, do you keep your
calendar up-to-date? Or is your calendar irrelevant? Is that preference
stated explicitly to the people who might reference your calendar? Is
your calendar visible to your coworkers?</p>
<p>Text chat is useful for asynchronous interrupts. Text chats are
better than stopping by in person or calling on the phone since
in-person drive-bys and phone calls interrupt whatever I’m thinking
about or discussing. The purpose of the text chat is either a reminder
or seeking a convenient time to talk.</p>
<p>Email is useful for notifications or questions or setting up
logistics. If I don’t respond to your question or request for action
within 2 days, please send a reminder.</p>
<p>Video calls are my preferred method for group meetings. Group
meetings via video call scheduled in advance on my calendar are best.
Impromptu video calls are acceptable but as interruptive as a phone
call.</p>
<p>In-person discussions are my preferred method for one-on-one
discussions. Stopping by my desk without an appointment interrupts
whatever I’m thinking about. If a calendar invitation is inconvenient, a
text chat confirming my availability before the in-person discussion is
helpful.</p>
<p>Phone is useful when the caller is unable to be present in-person.
Phone, being voice-only, is inferior to video calls. Unscheduled phone
calls interrupt whatever I’m thinking about. I’ve intentionally disabled
voicemail.</p>
<p>Status updates in electronic issue trackers or wikis or forums are
best (rather than email-only). Notifying in text chat or email that a
wiki page or issue is updated is helpful but not mandatory.</p>
<p>Given all those caveats, I prefer communication in any form at any
time over surprises.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure whether you should communicate, default to
communicating. If you’re not sure whether communication would interrupt
something, check my calendar and then communicate. If it’s urgent or
blocking progress, ignore my calendar.</p>
<p>Know when to switch communication channels. When to start in one
channel and then escalate. Text to phone to in person.</p>
<h2 id="communicating-professional-sense-of-vulnerability">Communicating
Professional Sense of Vulnerability<span
id="sec:professional-vulnerablity"
label="sec:professional-vulnerablity"></span></h2>
<p>Emotionally vulnerable communication is personal. You are exposing
personal issues. This personal emotional vulnerability deepens
relationships. The risk is that information could be used to manipulate
or harm.</p>
<p>Professional vulnerability is about being transparent about
bureaucratic issues. Processes and incentives are reasonable topics of
conversation among professionals. The ramifications are felt by
individuals, but a bureaucratic process aimed at an individual would be
unprofessional.</p>
<p>Discussions of internal intrigues of an organization are a form of
gossip among professional. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip">Gossip</a> can be
constructive (finding aspects to remedy) and lead to insights and shapes
cultural expectations within the bureaucracy. As with personal gossip,
professional gossip can risk harm if used against the organization.</p>
<p>As with personal vulnerability, professional vulnerability involves
learning who to share what information with when. In interacting with a
new-to-me person, I experiment by being professionally vulnerable and
see whether they reciprocate or at least explore the topic with me.
Being open and direct and curious helps the person I’m talking with feel
more comfortable. Shared introspection is the objective.</p>
<p>As an example, I say something like, “Perhaps the reason behind
(observation) is (reason 1) or (reason 2).” That gives the other person
a chance to brainstorm with me without committing to a position. If the
other person is unwilling to explore in depth, reverting to safer topics
is easy.</p>
<p>Being vulnerable does not mean the other person will reciprocate.
That is a risk on your part.</p>
<h2 id="social-and-bureaucratic-interactions">Social and Bureaucratic
interactions<span id="sec:socializing"
label="sec:socializing"></span></h2>
<p>Interactions with other people in an organization are either social
interaction or bureaucratic interaction.</p>
<p>As examples of each of these,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Social interaction example</em>: “Did you see the game on TV
last night? Our team really did well, right? I thought about getting
tickets for the game but they were sold out."</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bureaucratic interaction example</em>: “You’ll need to get
approval from Sue before presenting your idea to the board for their
review. Then talk with Russ and get his thoughts."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both social and bureaucratic interactions are vital to cohesion in an
organization of people.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic interaction can be broken into two subcategories: <span
data-acronym-label="visible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">visible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are written down and can be discovered by
stakeholders) and <span data-acronym-label="invisible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">invisible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are known to some stakeholders and are
conveyed verbally to some of the other stakeholders).</p>
<p>Invisible bureaucracy is akin to invisible domestic or relation work
outside the professional environment. The work associated with emotional
cohesion, logistics, planning, scheduling, and communicating is hard to
quantify so it does not get counted.</p>
<p>Processes default to invisible bureaucracy because documentation and
discoverability require work, and because some processes are
embarrassingly inefficient.</p>
<p>To make invisible bureaucracy visible, document the work.</p>
<p>The relevance of this jargon is to break down the components of an
organization’s “culture" experienced by participants. The ratio of
social relationship to visible bureaucracy to invisible bureaucracy is a
characterization of the culture. There are norms associated with each of
these three categories.</p>
<h2 id="communication-tips">Communication Tips</h2>
<p>The role of verbal and written communication is critical for
bureaucrats. Bureaucracy is distributed knowledge and distributed
decision making, both of which benefit from effective coordination.</p>
<p>Plenty of advice on effective communication (e.g., enunciate, speak
loud enough to be heard, be humble, be curious) exists; the advice below
is included because of specific relevance within bureaucratic
organizations. However, the following is generic to interactions outside
of bureaucracy.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Not all Interaction Challenges
are Communication problems</strong>.<br />
Sometimes an inability to discuss ideas is not a communication problem
but a psychological deficit of personality. Distinguishing “I’m an
ineffective communicator” from “the person I’m talking with doesn’t
communicate effectively” from “that person has a diagnosed psychological
reason they are unable to communicate” is tough for those of us who are
not psychologists or psychiatrists.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Avoid relying on
stereotypes</strong>.<br />
Within an organization different teams may build up reputations for
certain behaviors, or there may be significant events that the team is
associated with. When interacting with members of a team that has a
reputation, avoid relying on that stereotype or event as an opening for
discussion. You’re speaking to an individual, so discuss that person’s
behavior with them. Be curious.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Avoid questions that have a
binary response<span id="sec:yes-no-questions"
label="sec:yes-no-questions"></span></strong>.<br />
Responding to a request with “no” is helpful for the person replying to
the question. There is less work required, less risk of failure, and
better continuity. As an example of a poorly framed question, I could
ask, “Can I have a copy of the data you’re using?” The person I’m asking
is less disrupted if they refuse to share.</p>
<p>A more constructive phrasing is “I need information on X to work on
Y, and I think you have information about X. How can you help me get
information on X?” By clarifying my intent, I allow the person with the
data to provide options I may not have considered.</p>
<p>Similarly, when I’m being asked for information, I try to learn the
person’s intent motivating the question. Sometimes the requester doesn’t
actually know what to ask for. Instead of “no” I try to figure out how
to enable the person to be successful.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Leverage the other person’s
experience while focusing on your own<span id="sec:advice"
label="sec:advice"></span></strong>.<br />
Advice without context is less effective.<br />
<em>Bad</em>: “Here is what I think you should do in that
situation.”<br />
<em>Better</em>: “Here is what I did in that situation.”</p>
<p>People usually find talking about themselves an easy topic if you are
curious about their experiences. If you can learn the other person’s
background and history and motivations, you can weave that into the
advice you provide. Tailoring your message increases the likelihood of
implementation.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Avoid Platitudes<span
id="sec:platitudes" label="sec:platitudes"></span></strong>.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platitude">Platitudes</a> are
<span data-acronym-label="thought terminating"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">thought terminating</span>; the
statement feels true and is resistant to debate. Platitudes capture a
feeling with sufficient accuracy, but with imprecise language. As a
result, there’s no specific action.</p>
<p>Because platitudes result in a conclusion, the conversation
participants may feel more bonded. However, that bond is shallow.</p>
<p>Example platitudes to avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pick your battles.</p></li>
<li><p>Some things you can’t explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Your time will come.</p></li>
<li><p>You can be anything that you want to be.</p></li>
<li><p>I just want to get through this day.</p></li>
<li><p>It is what it is.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m just one person.</p></li>
<li><p>That’s that.</p></li>
<li><p>Life’s not perfect.</p></li>
<li><p>Life’s not fair.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s only so much you can do about it.</p></li>
<li><p>What is meant to be will be.</p></li>
<li><p>It is God’s will.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s part of God’s plan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If your goal is to understand a concept or issue deeply, you need to
use precise language.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Strive to use Precise
Language</strong>.<br />
Imprecise language causes miscommunication. Intent is unclear, as is
expected consequence. Typically people get away with imprecise language
because their actions are inconsequential. Only when the consequences
matter does the problem of imprecise language manifest.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip for Precision</em>: If you have a specific definition for a word
central to the topic of interest, ask your new collaborator for their
definition. Do not expect others to share your definition even when
there are established norms for the topic.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip for Precision</em>: Instead of asking a collaborator, “Are you
taking action on this topic?” ask “What actions are you taking on this
topic?”</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Tip for Precision</em>: If someone claims, “We plan to get to that
action,” ask for a timeline. A deadline can be for an artifact or a
re-evaluation of the topic.</p>
<p> <br />
Imprecise language takes less cognition to create and can take less time
to convey. Thinking harder about how to precisely convey an idea takes
effort. The importance of precise language is proportional to the
potential consequences of action/inaction/wrong action. Precision also
should be proportional to the complexity of the topic being
discussed.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Word is Bond<span
id="sec:word-is-bond" label="sec:word-is-bond"></span></strong>.<br />
Your communication (verbal, written) is your reputation. People rely on
what you tell them even if there isn’t legal recourse. Reliance on your
word is why precision matters.</p>
<p>Frustration and disappointment follow when you don’t uphold your
word, or others misinterpret your imprecise language, or you are
misunderstood.</p>
<p>Communication implies responsibility for the content. There is a
corresponding accountability in the relationship between speaker and
listener (or writer and reader).</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Take care near the Boundaries of
Knowledge</strong>.<br />
Trying to find someone else’s extent of knowledge is tricky – they don’t
want to appear stupid. They may interpret the exploration at a trap. “I
don’t know” can be an embarrassing statement to make, even if you don’t
share their embarrassment.</p>
<p>Knowing the limitations of your own knowledge and disclosing those
boundaries to others is critical. Distinguish what you know from
speculation about things you don’t.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Listen all the way to the last
word of the speaker</strong>.<br />
Formulating a response to the first part of an idea or a sentence is
tempting. Waiting for the speaker to finish before thinking of how to
response is courteous. Waiting creates a pause which makes you seem more
thoughtful.</p>
<p>This is complicated by the speakers who include long pauses for
contemplation and then resume.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Stop speaking over other
people<span id="sec:crosstalk"
label="sec:crosstalk"></span></strong>.<br />
Crosstalk occurs two people who are communicating verbally experience
interference from another audible conversation. That can occur because a
third person is talking at one of the original two participants, or when
four or more people are holding two separate conversations
concurrently.</p>
<p>Crosstalk in a bureaucracy is motivated by limited time available to
communicate. A meeting participant may feel inspired by something
someone else said and want to interject. Crosstalk can indicate
engagement and enthusiasm, or it can be due to the speaker wanting to
dominate the topic through interruption. The likelihood of crosstalk is
dependent on the level of aggressiveness of participants. In either case
(enthusiasm or power-seeking), the original speakers are disrespected.
The original speaker may feel annoyed at being interrupted.</p>
<p>The audience is frustrated by the lack of clarity of where to focus.
This distraction causes participants to lose of focus and productivity
of the interaction decreases.</p>
<p>Bystander intervention for out-of-control meeting: raise your hand.
This non-verbally reverts focus back to the discussion facilitator.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Account for Warnock’s
dilemma</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnock%27s_dilemma">Warnock’s
dilemma</a> is the common experience of figuring out how to interpret
not getting feedback. This is especially vital in meetings where the
speaker or facilitator needs to gauge participant comprehension of
delivered content. Simply asking “Does anyone not understand what I just
described?" is likely to get no response from attendees because
individuals want to avoid looking stupid.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Technique</em>: Pick an individual to provide a recap.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Technique</em>: Survey the audience using multiple choice to gauge
understanding.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Seek action with a
Deadline</strong>.<br />
When asking someone for help or input, specify a deadline for their
response. This helps the person rank the urgency of their tasks.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Make Deadlines
Explicit</strong></p>
<p>Typically requests have two deadlines. The first deadline is when a
response is sought. The second deadline is when a response is no longer
useful.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose I am inviting people to a meeting. I send the
invitation 5 days before the meeting and I want to know who is able to
attend by 3 days before the meeting. The second deadline is the time of
the meeting. Replies after that second deadline do not help me
understand who is going to attend.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Identify the cause of
miscommunication</strong>.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>miscommunication the cause is often due to definitions of words
used or differences in context. In this situation, more time spent
communicating and taking different approaches is sufficient to remedy
the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>A speaker may be inarticulate. If the speaker is unable to
coherently convey their internal experience to a listener, then the
communication failure is of a distinct category. No amount of added
communication will lead to improved understanding on the part of the
listener.</p></li>
<li><p>A speaker simply has nothing to say about a subject. Regardless
of whether they are capable of articulating a concept, they may be
unable to relate to the topic. Often a person in this situation still
wants to take part, but they are unable to meaningfully
contribute.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Empty talk is the use of words that are ill-defined, emotionally
resonant, inactionable, and impersonal.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>ask-tell-ask</strong>.<br />
Collaborating with fellow bureaucrats who have expertise in areas you do
not requires extra work. There may be differences in the words used to
describe certain situations, more precision in wording that you’re used
to, or thinking about situations in ways you are not familiar with. In
that context, to bridge the differences you can ask, tell, ask<a
href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The first step is asking what the other person’s perspective is on
the topic. This helps establish the appropriate level of nuance is and
can tell you how that person frames the issue. The second step is to
tell the person what you want to say. The “tell” step should leverage
what you learned from the first “ask” step. Use phrasing that is
consistent with what you just learned from the other person. The third
step is to ask the person what they heard from you. If they are unable
to tell you, you may need to refine your delivery. To improve the
likelihood of success keep the content in the second step short.</p>
<p>The ask-tell-ask technique can be used iteratively in the same
conversation, especially in discussion complex topics with a new
collaborator. Using ask-tell-ask takes long than just telling but
increases the effectiveness of the communication. You also get to learn
more about the other person’s perspective.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Initial responsiveness and status
updates</strong>.<br />
In a bureaucracy requiring approval, or asking for input, sometimes
waiting can provide value to the person doing the waiting. The request
may be overcome by events, or the person asking may remind which
indicates priority.</p>
<p>Whether you are the only recipient or one of many receivers can
change the intent of the email. Whether you are in the “to" or “cc"
field matters. Unfortunately, “to" versus “cc" are not reliable
indicators since email senders do not reliably conform to the expected
use.</p>
<p>An email sent to multiple recipients may have different purposes for
different readers. The reader’s role or knowledge may factor into how
they interpret the content. The inclusion or exclusion of recipients
alters how the content is understood.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Don’t seek Attribution for
Contributions; Credit Others<span id="sec:credit-others"
label="sec:credit-others"></span></strong>.<br />
Give credit to others for good ideas and beneficial actions. Either they
accept credit and you are seen as a contributor to their success, or
they push back and you look generous. Credit is not a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero sum
game</a>.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Offer to take Blame<span
id="sec:take-blame" label="sec:take-blame"></span></strong>.<br />
Before an action begins, tell collaborators that you are willing to
accept blame if something goes wrong. This alleviates their fear of
risks.</p>
<p><em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Survey
Stakeholders</strong>.<br />
</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Suppose you are a <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace
Corps</a> worker in Africa. You show up and the village doesn’t have
easy access to clean water. Villagers walk a long ways in dangerous
areas for dirty, unsafe water. This is an obvious problem and all the
villagers agree that they don’t have good water and that this problem
should be fixed.</p>
<p>Enacting the solution would take about a week - get the equipment to
the village, drill a well, build a pump.</p>
<p>You could take more time and involve the villagers in this project.
They could participate in getting the equipment, which should lead to a
sense of ownership. But then when the equipment shows up, they don’t
drill the well. If the well is drilled, it soon falls into disrepair and
the villagers are back to doing things they way they used to. What
happened?</p>
<p>The villagers don’t see access to clean water as the most significant
issue. You came in and imposed your view of what the problem is and how
to fix it. When you impose your view of what the problem is, the
solution won’t be adopted by villagers because they don’t prioritize it.
It is better to survey the community to see how they operate. What do
they think the problems are? Both leadership and the community members
need to provide priorities.</p>
<p>This issue is exacerbated if you come to the village as a
representative of a company providing wells. You are biased when you
ask, “Do you have any problems?"</p>
<p>Of course the villagers have water problems which could be fixed with
better wells. However, when you get into the details of placing or
improving a well, they lose interest. What the community really wants is
free installation, zero maintenance, easy to use, and no operational
costs. That would improve their life.</p>
</div>
<p>When you say there’s cost (both initial investment of capital and
then operations/maintenance) and a learning curve associated with the
solution, then the user’s interest wanes – you are presenting another
cost/benefit ratio for them to evaluate. Then they ask “Can we get by
without the well?" Yes, they don’t need the well – they’ve survived
without it.</p>
<p>Novel solutions (in this example, drilling a well and installing a
pump) have barriers to adoption. Two barriers are the current priorities
of the community and the incumbent solution/processes.</p>
<p>If there are problems with higher priority, the community will delay
enacting your solution. That’s fine if the higher-ranked priorities are
bounded, but they are often not. An example of this is the following:
Suppose a person has three tasks, and you introduce a solution which is
a fourth task. If the first task is “go from point A to point B," then
that task will eventually be eliminated and there will be three
remaining. If the second task is “secure your village," that is an
unbounded task. The person won’t get to or won’t prioritize your
low-ranked task.</p>
<p>How will your solution impact their higher-ranked priorities?</p>
<p> <br />
If enacting all these tips sounds like a lot of work, that’s because it
is. Effective written communication requires intentional effort because
of the lack of augmenting channels (compared to voice or video or
in-person).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="summary-of-what-action-should-be-carried-out">Summary of what action
should be carried out</h3>
<p>As the outsider, you should help the community enumerate and document
all of the problems they identify. Then you can help enumerate and
document how the problems are related (dependencies). Only then can you
help the community identify and document the root causes.</p>
<p>If the solution you, the outsider, identified really is the root
cause, then the community will arrive at that independently. If that is
the case, then you can enable them to enact a solution which addresses
the root causes. The community will then have a sense of ownership.</p>

<p><strong>Email is Structured</strong>: Originality is not a
requirement in bureaucratic writing. Plagiarism is acceptable. The
consistency of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs">Mad
Libs</a> template is efficient.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Email is a Piece of Art</strong>: Effort invested in each email
to improve readability means more than careful wording. Use visual cues
(different fonts, different font sizes, highlighting, font color) and
pictures to improve readability. See figure <a
href="#fig:email_computer_font" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:email_computer_font">8.4</a> for example.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Email is a Game</strong>: Email is a game of documenting
decisions and responses so that the sequence of interactions is clear
for audits and recrimination.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="email-responsiveness">Email
Responsiveness<span id="sec:email-responsiveness"
label="sec:email-responsiveness"></span></h3>
<p>There are three tiers of email responsiveness. Which level you are at
depends on the speed of your reading, how fast you can write, number of
incoming emails, number of outgoing emails, and how much time you
allocate for email.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You are able to read all emails and reply to all emails.</p></li>
<li><p>You are able to read all emails and reply to some.</p></li>
<li><p>You are unable to read all incoming emails.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following scenarios are focused on case 2, where you are able to
triage (skim) emails but do not have enough time to respond to each.</p>
<p>In a situation where you have insufficient time, which of the
following emails do you reply to? An email from your boss, an email from
your peer, an email from a person who reports to you, or a person who
you do not know? (The ratio of these email categories is not one to one
to one to one.)</p>
<p>The email from your boss is likely the top priority. Of the remaining
emails (peer, subordinate, unknown), the peer email is likely the next
priority. The subordinate and unknown person are likely last.</p>
<p>The consequence of triage is that when there’s insufficient time
available, your transparency to subordinates and unknown people is
likely to decrease.</p>
<p> <br />
Let’s consider another scenario requiring triage of email. Three emails
come in. One has no action, one is easy to reply to, and the third is
difficult and takes time. Which one gets the response? As with the
previous scenario, the ratio of these emails is not one to one to
one.</p>
<p>The email that is easy to reply to gets answered first. The email
that is difficult is second. If you only have time for one of the
emails, it’s likely to be the easy one. This is an example of <a

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="email-tips">Email Tips<span
id="sec:email-structure" label="sec:email-structure"></span></h3>
<p><em>Email Tip</em>: Good emails balance enough context (the why) and
relevant details (the what) against conciseness (word count).</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Emails convey both emotional tone and facts. Your
intent as an author is practically irrelevant; the reader’s perception
is paramount.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Use consistent design and structure for your emails.
Emails are part of your professional reputation.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Emails start with a greeting: Hi, Hello, Good
morning, Good afternoon, Good evening. Email greetings include the name
of the targeted recipient(s).</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Emails end with a professional closing, e.g.,
“Kindly", “Regards", etc.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Emails have a signature block with contact
information – phone number, normal hours of response, which timezone
you’re in if your team spans timezones, how long to wait for a response
before asking again, which communication channel I prefer, etc.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="images/email_template.png" id="fig:email_template"
style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Template for new email messages. Greeting
has a space after the comma – that is where the recipient’s name will
go. Signature block uses smaller after the name.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Email signature blocks do not include unnecessary
images, as that uses more storage for recipients. Email threads focused
on a specific instance of a recurring event include the date
(YYYY-MM-DD) in the subject line.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Based on the purpose of the email, example key
phrases for subject lines include: “meeting notes" versus “agenda"
versus “question about".</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Revising an existing subject line can disrupt the
ability of email software to thread conversations. However, sometimes
the revision is worth breaking threading.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: When replying to an ongoing thread, keep the
original message as part of the thread to provide readers historical
context.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: When replying to threads with sensitive messages,
sanitize the included content by removing name or identifying
details.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: If an email has multiple requests or questions, at
the top of the email (after the greeting) explicitly say how many of
each type. Then, in the body of the message, number them.</p>

separately highlight the action and indicate who is supposed to take the
action and what the deadline for response is.</p>

fixed-width font. This distinguishes the text from the rest of the
narrative.</p>

width.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: References to documents include a direct full
path.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: If referring to a previous separate thread, include
the subject and the date+time that email was sent</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: For bullet points, explicitly specify that items are
joined by one of the following: OR, XOR, AND.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: If you have an unordered list, explicitly state that
order is irrelevant.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: If you have a sequence of steps, number them and
indicate which steps are required versus optional</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Use visual sketches to illustrate concepts rather
than always relying on text. Don’t use pictures all the time, and don’t
have too many pictures in an email.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Know how to both embed pictures inline and how to
attach files and when to use which. Email replies should preferentially
be at the top of the thread. If replying to multiple points in the
previous email, embed replies inline, mark the distinction, and
highlight the authorship.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bob’s reply to Sue’s questions. The third
question is not shown in this illustration.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: If replying inline, explicitly state that at the top
of the thread.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: If the email is longer than a paragraph, provide a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)">B.L.U.F</a>
or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read">tl;dr</a>
or summary. In general emails should be short. Longer discussions should
be held on the phone or in person, with a summary report after the
discussion. Reliance on a BLUF or tl;dr risks resulting in the reader
skipping the content.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Every email should have a purpose. What are you
asking the recipient to do? How do you want them to feel? How should
they respond?</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: When replying, starting your email with an
expression of gratitude for the work the recipient has done so far sets
a positive tone by acknowledging their investment.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email Tip</em>: Read each email and report to determine the purpose.
If you don’t have time to read everything, skim the content.</p>
<p><em>Problematic behavior</em>: First you scan the text of a message
to see if there is immediate action or response needed. If no action or
response is needed, go to the next email.<br />
That may not work for emails that have logistics associated with future
events, or emails that alter your perception of the situation.</p>
<p>If you read an email to figure out the purpose of the email, that
will help determine what action and response are relevant. Here I’m
using “action" to refer to activities outside the email channel.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="why-did-this-email-get-sent">Why did this
Email get sent?</h3>
<p>Below are potential intentions of the person writing the email.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Decision needed</strong>. Typically
includes context.<br />
<em>Action</em>: if the team maintains a decision log, update that.
Response is selection of a choice.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Instead of asking for a decision, ask if the person is
opposed. See <a href="#sec:approval-forgiveness-opposition">approval and
forgiveness and opposition</a> on page  for more details.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Instead of asking for a decision, ask for the go-ahead.
This framing biases the respondent towards action (specifically
approval) rather than thinking.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Situational awareness</strong>.<br />
<em>Action</em>: Expected default is no action, but interject if there’s
an issue.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Action or Tasking</strong>.<br />
<em>Action</em>: Do something within a specified deadline.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Approval sought</strong>.<br />
<em>Action</em>: Confirm or deny.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Feedback sought</strong>.<br />
<em>Action</em>: Assessment of proposal.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Meeting logistics</strong>. Can be an
announcement (widely available), registration (limited attendance), or
invitation (specific to you). Attendance is either optional or
required.<br />
<em>Action</em>: Create or update a calendar event. Response should
restate the logistics (specifically the time and date and location and
purpose) to confirm.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Brainstorming</strong><br />
May provoke a response for building on an idea. “For your situational
awareness, no action needed." Notification of activity by someone else.
Or change in plans. If needed, a correction to the described direction
might trigger a response or even a meeting.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Reference</strong> e.g. describing a
process, or a business workflow, or a citation.<br />
<em>Action</em>: Copy process documentation to wiki. Copy citation to
bibliography. Acknowledgement response thanking the sender for the
update or clarification.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Setting a formal policy or issuing an
informal edict</strong>.<br />
<em>Action</em>: move the policy or edict documentation to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(software)">Confluence</a>
or Wiki. Acknowledgement response needed only if the edit is aimed at
just me or the group I am leading.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Email intent</em>: <strong>Question</strong>.<br />
If this is a recurring question, move to a “Frequently Asked Questions"
page on a Confluence or Wiki. Response needed that provides answer or
seeks clarification.</p>
<h2 id="friction-between-teams-within-an-organization">Friction between
teams within an organization</h2>
<p>Ideally there is a clear division of responsibilities among teams.
Even in that context there is necessarily some interaction among teams –
one team may depend on the output from another team. Coordination among
the teams regarding transfer of data or products or projects or
knowledge is critical to the smooth operation of the organization.</p>
<p>An organization has finite staffing, money, time. Therefore, teams
within the organization face a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum</a>
distribution of resources.</p>
<p>Difference of decision making perspective based on local conditions,
stupidity, or different incentives, different definitions of success</p>
<p>When attempting to resolve friction between teams, there is an
authority common to the teams, but that person lacks the nuanced
insight, doesn’t have time to get involved in every challenge, and
doesn’t want to micromanage multiple teams.</p>
<p>Stakeholders care about the outcome of a decision. In some sense,
every participant in an organization is invested the outcome of every
decision made because there is consequence to how resources are divided
and the direction of the organization. Every org member has an opinion,
even lacking experience or expertise.</p>
<h2 id="financial-models-of-communication">Financial models of
communication</h2>
<p>Late to a meeting is theft, and poorly written email and email to the
wrong people has financial cost.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="meeting-time-compared-to-theft">Meeting time
compared to theft</h3>
<p>In large organizations, there can be significant bureaucracy
associated with even small purchases. A multi-step review process may be
incurred for a $2000 acquisition.</p>
<p>Another measurement of value is that if an employee were to steal
even $200 worth of materials, the organization would likely punish that
employee.</p>
<p>In the book High Output Management <span class="citation"
data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove 1995)</span>, Grove points out that those
metrics apply to tangible goods, but not to people’s time. Consider a
meeting of 10 people and each person’s cost is $200 per hour. A wasted
meeting is not unusual and certainly would not incur bureaucratic review
processes. The cost to the organization is fiscally the same – $2000.
Similarly, consider an employee who is late and causes a loss of
productivity. Merely depriving the organization of $200 worth of time is
not punished in the same way theft is.</p>
<p>In fact, organizations default to meetings (even recurring meetings)
rather than not meet. And being late to a meeting is accepted.</p>
<p>We can debate the differences between theft of materials and theft of
time. The financial argument is clear.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="email-is-not-free">Email is not free</h3>
<p>Total cost of email:</p>

<em>Meeting tip</em>: <strong>Create and use an Agenda</strong>.<br />
<em>Bad</em>: no meeting agenda<br />
<em>Good</em>: Have an agenda.<br />
<em>Better</em>: <u>Share the agenda with other participants</u>. Having
an agenda keeps attendees focused. Enables tracking of progress during
the meeting so participants are more likely to get to all topics.<br />
<em>Best</em>: For formal meetings, <u>share the agenda in writing
before meeting</u>. Sharing the agenda in advance allows attendees to
prepare.</p>
<p>Forces conspiring against agendas: takes time to create an agenda.
Attendees might not take the time to read beforehand. Attendees may not
stick to the agenda during the meeting.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Meeting tip</em>: <strong>Ensure facilities are
adequate</strong>.<br />
For formal in-person meetings verify meeting venue has enough space,
seating, working IT equipment. For formal virtual meetings ensure
participants are familiar with virtual meeting controls. As a bureaucrat
you may not see taking care of details like this as your responsibility.
Ensuring well-run logistics and effective use of infrastructure may not
be your area of expertise, you lack training in this domain, it’s not in
your job description, and you won’t get promoted for taking care of
it.</p>
<p>Attention to detail outside the scope of your official duties
benefits your reputation. Proactive concern for the smooth operation of
the bureaucracy enables efficiency in time and resources.</p>
<p>Fire alarm or other emergencies.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Meeting tip</em>: <strong>Body language matters</strong></p>
<p>If you are not speaking, are you reclined or leaning forward on the
edge of your seat? Are you looking at the speaker?</p>
<p>If your eyes are closed, other people don’t know if you’re picturing
something or falling asleep.</p>
<p>If you approve of something but don’t want to verbally interject, a
thumbs up is useful signaling.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Meeting tip</em>: <strong>Take and share Meeting
Notes</strong>.<br />
Meeting notes are more detailed than the agenda but less detailed than a
transcript of who said what. Meeting notes synthesize the discussion.
Meeting notes specify follow-on who is taking which actions with what
deadlines.</p>
<p>See also the discussion on <a
href="#sec:written-comm-does-not-happen">why meeting notes do not get
taken</a>.</p>

<em>Meeting tip</em>: <strong>Facilitator ensures Presenters are
Capable</strong>.<br />
Does the presenter know how to project materials? How to present
slides?</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Meeting tip</em>: <strong>Facilitator’s ground rules</strong>.<br />
To run a smooth and productive meeting, I explicitly state two ground
rules to the attendees:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want to talk, raise your hand and I will call on you. If
there are multiple people wanting to talk, I’ll track the order of
speakers.</p></li>
<li><p>If you talk too long, I’ll cut you off.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach is critical when there are many people present, when
people with diverse backgrounds are present, or when there is a mixture
of dominant and submissive personalities present. If a visual signal
like hand raising is not used, reliance on verbal interruption defaults
to dominant personalities. Waiting for a person to finish speaking
doesn’t work for everyone because some participants will use more than
their fair share of time. speaking for a long time needs to be addressed
regardless of whether an intentional effort to exclude others or a
consequence of verbosity.</p>
<p>As a facilitator, my focus is on structure (distinct phases of the
discussion) and ensuring participation. I remove myself from taking part
in the discussion.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Meeting tip</em>: <strong>Facilitate Asking Dumb Questions without
Feeling Intimidated</strong>.<br />
Asking a question of an expert from a position of ignorance can feel
intimidating. You may worry you’re wasting the expert’s time. In a
recurring meeting a facilitator can address this by having participants
write questions on paper and submitting anonymously. The questions or
discussion topics can then be raised at following meetings.</p>
<p>To facilitate the anonymity every participant must be given paper and
pen, and every participant must write something on the paper. The
facilitator then has to collect the paper from each participant. For
contributors who don’t have a question, they can write down feedback
about the meeting.</p>
<p>This technique allows the expert to get the information needed for a
response, or to figure out who the best person to respond is.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Meeting tip</em>: <strong>Collect feedback from Attendees on How to
Improve</strong></p>
<p>Follow up with meeting attendees to get feedback on how to
improve.</p>
<h2 id="characterizing-meetings">Characterizing Meetings</h2>
<p>Characterizing meetings is critical to distinguishing which norms are
applicable, and what people expect from the different formats.</p>
<p>Types of meetings: internal meetings, customer meetings, conferences,
scheduled one-on-ones, impromptu walk-around.</p>
<p>There are many potential purposes of a meeting, including</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To gather input from attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>To make a pronouncement to attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>To educate attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>To educate one person.</p></li>
<li><p>To signal interaction.</p></li>
<li><p>To brainstorm ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>To make progress towards an goal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the purpose is not explicitly stated, confusion arises. When
multiple purposes occur in one meeting and the transition is not
explicitly stated, confusion arises. The reason for this confusion is
that the assumptions and expectations and norms of each purpose are
different. When the attendees don’t know the purpose or the purpose
shifts, the expected behaviors and roles are unclear.</p>
<p>An attendee can ask what the purpose of the meeting is during the
meeting but that is generally considered rude. An attendee can try to
deduce the purpose of a meeting, but this takes time and attention and
can result in the wrong conclusion. An attendee can try to set the
purpose of the meeting during the meeting, but this can conflict with
the intent of other attendees.</p>
<p>A meeting’s purpose can shift during a meeting. If done
intentionally, the changes should be stated explicitly. Otherwise an
attendee may continue to work under the previous set of expectations
rather than the current norms.</p>
<p>Level of formality, start time (early or on time or late), end time
(early or on time or late), utility, duration, number of attendees,
number of speakers, number of participants.</p>
<p>Meetings involve people, either known or strangers. Meetings involve
information, either relevant or irrelevant. Relevant information is
either new or related to previous work. Meetings either have a leader or
no leader (brainstorming). If there’s a leader, the leader may be
disseminating info to participants, or gathering information from
attendees.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="phases-of-a-meeting">Phases of a meeting</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Establish understanding of what the topic is. Without a shared
focus and a common goal a meeting is unlikely to be productive.</p></li>
<li><p>Set aside topics that are not the focus. Either discuss outside
the current meeting or defer to a later meeting. Managing scope is
critical to accomplishing the goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a shared language specific to the topic and to the
participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish each participant’s viewpoint on the topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Brainstorm options.</p></li>
<li><p>Build consensus or nominate a decider.</p></li>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="walk-around-impromptu-meetings">Walk-around
impromptu meetings<span id="sec:walk-arounds"
label="sec:walk-arounds"></span></h3>
<p>Meetings aren’t constrained to occur in conference rooms around a
table with everyone seated. Walking around the shared office space and
having conversations with coworkers can be an intentional form of
informal meeting.</p>
<p>Ambushing coworkers when they aren’t expecting interruption takes
tact. As the (potential) interrupter, you need to be sensitive that
other people may not want to be interrupted, while others seek diversion
from their current task. If you’re the person being interrupted by the
coworker walking around, you have the right of deferral.</p>
<p>Walking-around and finding people to talk with can be for <a
href="#sec:socializing">social engagement</a> (see more on page ) or to
discuss tasks you are working on.</p>
<p>In the American Revolution, <a

von Steuben</a> and George Washington both did walk-around meetings to
understand needs of the members of their army.</p>

check-in meetings<span id="sec:meetings-one-on-one"
label="sec:meetings-one-on-one"></span></h3>
<p>Formal one-on-one meetings of a supervisor and a team member.
Opportunity for the supervisor to coach the team member and for the
supervisor to learn what the problems are on the team. From the team
member’s perspective, a one-on-one is an opportunity to ensure alignment
with the team’s direction and to provide insight on how to improve the
team. Education in both directions.</p>
<p>One-on-one discussion take lot of time, so the mindset “no news is
good news" or “everything is going well, no need to engage" is tempting.
As a consequence only negative feedback causes interaction.</p>
<p>One-on-one meeting questions for helping the supervisor understand
the team member’s status. The one-on-one check-in should be tailored to
the phase of the employee’s progression. Frequency of check-ins depends
on the newness of the team member, the complexity of the work, or how
quickly the conditions are changing.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Welcome to the team!</u><br />
<em>Scenario: New team member, either new to the team or new to the
organization.</em><br />
Here the focus of the one-on-one is to ensure a smooth on-boarding
process. Get them up-to-speed on the technical challenges, professional
norms, and integrated with other team members. Resolve administrative
blockers: Does the employee have the necessary computer log-in accounts?
Do they have an email account? Are they on the mailing list?<br />
Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the goals for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>What items on the onboarding checklist are not yet
completed?</p></li>
<li><p>Who have you met on the team? What is your understand of their
role on the team?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The duration of this phase could last between a day and two
weeks.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Initial contributions</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Team member handles small tasks.</em><br />
The one-one-one is for discussions on training and planning and task
reviews. Characterized by the team member being dependent on others for
their success. In this phase the employee collaborates on tasks.<br />
Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the goals for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>What are your task goals?</p></li>
<li><p>What are you expecting to deliver to the team? When?</p></li>
<li><p>What dependencies does that deliverable have (external to the
team or internal to the team)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The duration of this phase could last a few months to
years.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Experienced contributor</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Team member handles large tasks (which get broken into
subtasks).</em><br />
The one-on-one is to help the team member define their success.
Activities include planning, resource allocation, assessment.
Characterized by the need to coordinate with others on the team or other
teams. Team member understands task scope and intent and relevant
processes. Team member decomposes task into subtasks.<br />
Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do the artifacts you’re working on support your plan for the
team’s progress?</p></li>
<li><p>What dependencies does that deliverable have (external to the
team or internal to the team)?</p></li>
<li><p>What insights do you have about the team or
organization?</p></li>
<li><p>What insights do you have about the relevance of the task
relative to the intent of the organization?</p></li>
<li><p>What should management be doing to enable the team’s
success?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The duration of this phase could be the rest of a
career.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Facilitator</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Facilitating the productivity of others.</em><br />
Rather than being task-oriented, this team member supports
coworkers.<br />
Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What observations from mentoring team members do you
have?</p></li>
<li><p>What collaborations should we be fostering?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Peer</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Peer check-in.</em><br />
This one-on-one is a form of mentorship. The value of the exchange is to
get a different perspective and to hold each other accountable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To evaluate when a team member and their supervisor should move to
the next phase in the evolution, have an explicit conversation about the
threshold for progression.</p>
<p>In addition to phase-specific questions, there are questions that fit
all phases. A supervisor should ask the team member</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What have you been successful with since we last met?</p></li>
<li><p>What is blocking our team’s progress?</p></li>
<li><p>What are your plans?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you collaborating with the rest of the team?</p></li>
<li><p>If there was just one thing you could change about our
organization, what would it be and why?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you plan to train your coworkers on topics you understand
and they don’t?</p></li>
<li><p>What have you learned in the past month?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the biggest risks for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s limiting your productivity?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Responding to these questions takes time (an hour) and willingness to
be open.</p>
<p>If the supervisor doesn’t ask these questions, the team member has
the ability to include these in the agenda and to bring them up.</p>
<p> <br />
A one-on-one meeting requires preparation. Before the meeting the team
member should document</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What was discussed previously.</p></li>
<li><p>What progress has been made since the previous meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>What is blocking progress.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bad-presentations">Bad Presentations</h2>
<p>Occasionally I attend a bad presentation. The slides may appear slick
but the content is poorly thought out. Or the presenter does not
understand the topic well. Or the presenter has good content but does
not convey it well. Or the presenter is wrong about the topic.
Regardless of the cause, I assume the presenter is making their best
effort.</p>
<p>I could remain silent, complain, criticize, ask leading questions, or
offer constructive feedback. My silence may result in other attendees
and the presenter leaving with incomplete or wrong information. If I
speak up I’ll prolong the meeting or limit the presenter’s time to
convey their material.</p>
<p>My assessment of the presentation may be wrong. I may lack relevant
information. A reliable technique for interjection is to assume a state
of confusion instead of confidently asserting the presenter is wrong. If
I believe the presenter is wrong, asking about the source of the
information is a good entry point.</p>
<p>When the information is correct but presented poorly (or above the
level I understand), I ask for clarification.</p>
<h1 id="bureaucratic-processes">Bureaucratic Processes<span
id="sec:process" label="sec:process"></span></h1>
<p>If you haven’t pondered bureaucratic policies and processes before,
consider your own personal habits. You might eat at the same time every
day, or you might go to bed at the same time. Those are both examples of
personal policies. In the same way, bureaucrats in organizations seek
routines to decrease uncertainty.</p>
<p>Comparing bureaucratic processes for organizations to a person’s
habits is intended to make the concept relatable to your experiences.
Both are routines which ease the burden of decision making. A habit can
be intentional (e.g., my policy is to brush my teeth before going to
bed), just as a process can be designed. Habits can be unconscious
(e.g., arriving at work without recalling driving there), just as
processes can arise without design.</p>
<p>An intentional habit of an individual person is motivated by a
personal policy. Similarly, bureaucrats acting on behalf of an
organization apply processes that support the policies of the
organization.</p>
<h2 id="definition-of-process-and-policy">Definition of Process and
Policy<span id="sec:definition-of-process"
label="sec:definition-of-process"></span></h2>
<p>A bureaucratic <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> is a sequence of
tasks, with each task invoking policy enforcement by bureaucrats. The
<span data-acronym-label="policy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">policy</span> of an organization is a
decision about what action is required, allowed, or not allowed.</p>
<p>A process has inputs and outputs. A process can be decomposed into
other processes. Processes operate on both information and tangible
objects. Processes require <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)">work</a> and time.
Processes are carried out by people or machines.</p>
<p>The alternative to process is an <a
href="#sec:exceptions-to-process">exception</a> – see page  for more
details. Creating and maintaining processes is burdensome, as is dealing
with exceptions. This is the <a
href="#table:policy-consistency-across-cases">Dilemma of Consistent
Policies</a>.</p>
<p>There are options for responding to policies and processes. You
can</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Accept them. The default for most bureaucrats in an established
organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Intentionally break them maliciously. Typically limited to a
small number of participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Intentionally break them for disruptive innovation. Your
perception of innovation may be indistinguishable from malice for other
bureaucrats.</p></li>
<li><p>Be ignorant of them. This may initially be easier for you but
causes friction for everyone else and results in you being less
effective.</p></li>
<li><p>Work in an environment where the rules have not yet been set.
Here you are limited in scale or complexity, or you will need to form
new policies and processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Processes are typically divided into separate tasks associated with
distinct roles. The distinction of roles originates in skill
specialization, separation of responsibilities, and narrow authority.
When there is insufficient staffing then individual bureaucrats have
multiple roles. This can lead to a conflict of interest among the roles
and is experienced by the bureaucrat as a dissonance. For example, when
one person has both the responsibility to implement the plan and review
the completed implementation, the oversight is ineffective. <a
href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Processes are important for organizations because they create a
defensible story for the bureaucrats involved. The processes are not
correlated with fair distribution of the shared resource managed by the
bureaucracy. Management of shared resources require policies, and
implementing policies require processes. The processes are one step
removed from the management of the shared resources.</p>
<p>The above observations are theoretical and generic, but there’s
already some practical relevance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The point to understanding concepts like process and policy is so
that you know when to work within versus work around, when to accept
versus change, when to ignore, how to leverage, and how to
design.</p></li>
<li><p>As a bureaucrat you administer a process. When you do that, check
that the person you are inflicting the process on can explain the steps
back to you. If they cannot, their confusion will likely create more
work for the bureaucrats.</p></li>
<li><p>As the subject of a process, check that your understanding of the
process is consistent with the bureaucrat’s intent. Summarize the next
steps and applicable deadlines so they can confirm.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The simplification necessary for making policies and the neglect of
specific circumstances results in <span
data-acronym-label="process friction"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process friction</span>. Process
friction manifest in waste of resources (tangible or expertise),
temporal inefficiency, emotional frustration, and social distrust of
institutions.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="types-of-process">Types of Process</h3>
<p>The generic definition of process above obscures distinct
subcategories. In practice there are three types of processes: heroic,
bureaucratic, and social.</p>
<p>A <u>heroic process</u> is exemplified by a single person or a small
number of people doing the work associated with a specific task. The
person may be acting in multiple roles and typically relies on expertise
from multiple domains. This approach is not sustainable as there’s
significant dependence on the hero(s). The heroic process is a common
pattern because it minimizes the work of other bureaucrats and is more
efficient because there’s less hand-off between bureaucrats. The heroic
process may cause demoralization of the hero and result in burn-out.</p>
<p>Processes with fewer people and fewer steps can be quicker and use
fewer resources, but they are more fragile and are less representative.
Having more people involved helps with edge cases but slows down the
process. Hero culture is rarely an intentional design; it is based on
personalities and cost to the organization. Redundancy like having a
buddy system (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair
programming</a> for software, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_1">RAID
1</a> for data storage) costs more in the short term.</p>
<p>The arguments against hero culture center on the long-term benefits
of resilience and scalability. Those motivations lead to the next type
of process.</p>
<p>A <u>bureaucratic process</u> is a sequence of steps with each step
administered by a different bureaucrat. The steps of the process may not
be communicated to process participants, which often causes frustration
when the subject of bureaucracy has to discover each step sequentially.
The number of steps in the bureaucratic process may seem onerous to
subjects going through the process because of the multiple interactions
with different bureaucrats (compared to the heroic process). The process
often takes longer than desired due to loss of information and context
in the hand-off among bureaucrats. The participant has to re-explain the
same background to each bureaucrat.</p>
<p>In contrast to heroic processes and social processes, bureaucratic
processes are associated with forms (paper or electronic). Forms are
meant to ensure consistent application of policy, and to catch people
who shouldn’t get the resource (both in cases of accidental request and
malicious request). For malicious requests, a more burdensome process
merely filters the low-cost grifters.</p>
<p>A <u>social process</u> is undocumented and relies on relationships
instead of hierarchy. There is a strong sensitivity to prior experiences
of the bureaucrats and on the skills of the people involved. There is no
single person that represents or manages the social network, so the
entry point is through relationships with bureaucrats who have existing
connections.</p>
<p>Once distinctions are recognized, tactics can be used to address the
challenges associated with each.</p>
<p>If you are blocked by the hero of a heroic process, you can try
waiting until the hero leaves. Given burn-out and turn-over, sometimes
this is only a few years. Alternatively, you can try creating a positive
relationship with the hero. If you’re the hero and don’t want to be,
look for ways to transition to bureaucratic or social processes.</p>
<p>For the social process, participants are swayed by reputation more
than title. Prestige and reputation matter. Doing favors for
participants helps. Bring cookies and donuts and brownies fosters
relationships and good will. Instead of bringing food when a favor is
needed, bring food on a recurring basis before the favor is needed.</p>
<p>Social processes can work well for small tasks that are infrequent.
Social processes can be effective in anomalous situations.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic processes are useful under typical conditions. When you
are forced to use a bureaucratic process, avoid starting with the most
important or hardest problem. Send a test dummy through the sequence of
steps. This enumerates the process, provides a measure of the time
needed to get through the process, and identify key personnel. In an
ideal bureaucratic process your reputation wouldn’t matter. That
assumption turns out to not be valid.</p>
<p>Thinking of bureaucratic processes in opposition to social
relationships is a false dichotomy. Bureaucratic processes are
formalized versions of interactions intended to displace the need for
social relationships among bureaucrats.</p>
<p>When no process exists, only people with relationships succeed.
Processes enable novices to an organization to contribute value and gain
experience.</p>
<p>Processes (whether heroic, bureaucratic, or social) are not
consistent because relationships vary – both among the bureaucrats
administering the process and the person going through the process.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="why-do-processes-exist">Why do Processes Exist?<span
id="sec:why-processes-exist"
label="sec:why-processes-exist"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations manage shared resources (tangible or
expertise). A subjective decision about a resource that is administered
by bureaucrats is a <span data-acronym-label="policy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">policy</span>. Processes inform the
decision making of bureaucrats and result in access to or denial of
shared resources.</p>
<p>The following sections provide more explanation for why organizations
rely on processes. The reasoning matters to you as a bureaucrat when you
design a process or try to revise an existing process. Similarly, as a
person going through a process, the reasoning below explains why you are
experiencing <span data-acronym-label="process friction"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process friction</span>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-ensure-consistent-application-of-policy">Processes Ensure
Consistent Application of Policy</h3>
<p>Organizations are designed to be insensitive to individual
participants; that applies to both bureaucrats and subjects. Processes
address risk to the allocated resource and risk to the bureaucrats
carrying out the process.</p>
<p>The risk addressed by the use of processes is both current bad
behavior and the potential of things going bad in the future. Process is
the guardrail limiting harm to bureaucrats and the shared resource.</p>
<p>One motive for bureaucracy is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of
the Commons</a>, which says that when there is a shared resource someone
will try to get away with behavior that is harmful to the community of
users. Limiting harmful behavior can take the form of oversight
processes. If oversight processes are not in place malicious actors
dominate.</p>
<p>Another example guardrail is keeping stakeholders informed
(justifications) so that intervention can be taken if needed.</p>
<p>In isolation each process for oversight/review/approval may be
justifiable, but the aggregate can feel unreasonably burdensome to both
subjects and bureaucrats.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="processes-exist-to-simplify">Processes exist
to Simplify</h3>
<p>Compared to an ad hoc approach, processes are intended to simplify
what could otherwise be complicated moral decisions, coordination
challenges, or financial assessments.</p>
<p>A positive view is that specialization allows narrow focus and thus
deeper understanding and skill. An alternative perspective is that
specialization allows for dumbing down the role, thus enabling a cheaper
workforce. In that view process allows dumb individuals to, as a group,
do complicated things. As a specific example, consider the process of
designing and building a car. That complexity is feasible to undertake
for a skilled and knowledgeable individual, but the cheaper approach is
to hire individuals capable of installing the passenger-side doors in an
assembly line.</p>
<p>The relation between complexity of a task and skill of the
bureaucratic workforce is another motive for the creation of processes.
See figure <a href="#fig:complexity-and-size" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:complexity-and-size">3.1</a> on page  for a
visualization of the trade-off.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-enable-increased-throughput">Processes Enable Increased
Throughput</h3>
<p>Processes that leverage specialization can improve scalability. Adam
Smith’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process#Adam_Smith">pin
factory example</a> cites a productivity gain of 240x. Similarly, the
introduction of moving assembly lines in Ford’s car factory produced an
8x improvement of throughput <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.</p>
<p>While social processes may work well for low-volume ad-hoc requests,
formalized bureaucratic processes become necessary for recurring
high-volume activities.</p>

data-cites="1943_Selznick">(Selznick 1943)</span>. The needs of
individual members of an organization may be at odds with (or at least
not aligned with) the purpose of the organization. This dissonance is
observed as the interplay between personal relationships and
bureaucratic processes.</p>
<p>Generalizing claims about social bonds in an organization is
unfounded. For a given complexity and given scale, there are people who
are more social and less social and therefore desire more or less
process. There are bureaucrats who want documented processes and are
confused as to how things are operating when those aren’t present.</p>
<p>The invisibility of social relationships limits bureaucrats not
attuned to the importance of these bonds. Social influence among
bureaucrats lacks transparency– discoverability and documentation. In
contrast, processes are easier to understand and to track. The counter
to social influence is the hierarchical <span
data-acronym-label="org chart" data-acronym-form="singular+short">org
chart</span> described on page . Social influence is not antithetical to
processes. There’s always a mixture of the two.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-help-new-bureaucrats-and-subjects">Processes Help New
Bureaucrats and Subjects</h3>
<p>Bureaucrats new to a team are likely to ask, “What are the processes
and where is the documentation?” Bureaucrats who have been on a team for
a long time say, “Don’t burden me with processes, I just need to get
things done using the relationships with the people I have.” One motive
for processes is to help with onboarding team members who don’t have
relationships available.</p>
<p>Besides not having formed a social network, there’s a second reason
new people seek processes. New team members who recently graduated from
school are used to the existence of formal processes at the high school
or university level. Therefore when they join a job, they expect a
similar set of conditions for processes to exist and follow.</p>
<p>Once this motive for processes is recognized, the relevance when
onboarding new hires is apparent. New hires will need to discover the
existing processes while they form social bonds. Discovering processes
comes through oral folklore or written documentation. To augment both
process discovery and creation of relationship, one technique is to have
new hires sit with experienced team members. This is described in the
section on <a href="#sec:prisoner-exchange">Prisoner exchange</a> on
page . Where you sit matters to your effectiveness as a bureaucrat.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-exist-as-artifacts-for-promotion">Processes exist as
Artifacts for Promotion</h3>
<p>Processes can arise organically (bottom up) or be created top-down.
In either context, creating new processes counts as bureaucratic
innovation. Process creation is confused as promotion-worth because of
the distinction between novelty and innovation. Real innovation incurs
risk, whereas new processes are merely novel. Both cause change, but
processes are typically designed to decrease risk.</p>
<h2 id="riding-the-chaos">Riding the Chaos</h2>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations are not perfect. Somethings work, others
do not. A bureaucratic organization is a complex and chaotic<a
href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> environment. A natural response is
to impose processes and hierarchy and roles. Imposing structure can feel
intellectually fulfilling and emotionally satisfying. Imposing structure
looks like progress and may even help with your promotion in the
hierarchy. The challenge (or continual source of employment) is that
chaos is dynamic. A process created in response to chaos create new
problems and is disrupted by changes in number of staff, changes to who
is part of the process, changes to amount of work. The half-life of
structure depends on the rate of change of tasking and the rate of <a
href="#sec:turnover">personnel turn-over</a>; see page .</p>
<p>A bureaucrat in the organization could strive for perfection, run
away from the chaos (to something less chaotic), exploit the chaos, or
adopt an attitude of “I do what I can” or “I’ll wait out the problem.”
Another option is to build skills for navigating the chaos of a
bureaucratic organization.</p>
<p>Build and maintain your network of connections with fellow
bureaucrats. This augments the chain of command of a hierarchy. There is
a turn-over in both hierarchical roles and in your professional network,
which means you need to continually invest effort in creating new bonds
and maintain existing relations.</p>
<p>See change as an opportunity for improvement rather than a
destruction of your previous investments. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">sunk cost fallacy</a>
applies to your emotional state and the resources you invested. Fear of
change is understandable – it disrupts the comfort of stability and
known processes. Anticipating change and preparing for it ease the
stress of change.</p>
<p>Leverage personalities and unique traits rather than expecting
everyone to be interchangeable and treating differences as flaws. By
knowing the strengths, interests, and weaknesses of coworkers you can
facilitate the process of change.</p>

<p>For a workplaces that deal with intangibles the sequential process of

<p>The evolution of automating a process involves</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Identify who is involved in the process. How did the process get

<li><p>Transition from plain text documentation to structured data.
Examples of structured computer-parsable text include decision trees and

<li><p>Create an automation assistant that actively monitors your

</ol>
<p>The skill of identifying opportunities to automate depends on
practical skill (what are you capable of) and experience.</p>
<p> <br />
Automating bureaucracy from the bottom-up can be augmented and supported
by management. At the organizational level, there are system-level
changes like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hire people who desire automation and the skills to enact
automation.</p></li>
<li><p>Use tracking bits in PDFs and webpages to collect data on how
systems are used. This decreases the burden on process participants to
report metrics and can be less biased since it does not rely on
self-reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a metrics aggregation service. The ability to store
metrics from multiple teams enables a holistic perspective on the
organization and can help identify chokepoints. Without the ability to
view the entire organization, premature optimization is likely.</p></li>
<li><p>Align incentives (e.g., pay, promotion) with implementation of
automation.</p></li>

typically involve a Person new to the Process</h2>
<p>Bureaucratic processes require working with other people. One source
of friction is that participants may lack familiarity with the
process.</p>
<p>This observation can be quantified with a small number of
assumptions. The distribution of employee tenure might fit a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law
distribution</a> – there are more inexperienced people than experienced
people. What matters in this context is how long the employee has been
in their role (rather than how long they’ve been a member of the
organization). Therefore let’s assume a max tenure of 10 years<a
href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. If the process involves 5 people,
the least experienced member will have a median 97 calendar days of
experience.</p>

<p>Three calendar months (or 70 business days) may be inadequate for
complex processes or processes that are infrequent (quarterly or
annual), especially if there was no training. When the number of
participants is 10 people, then the median tenure of the youngest
participant is 51 calendar days (37 business days).</p>
<p>To recap, the assumption made were</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Random independent sampling of organization members.</p></li>
<li><p>Tenure in role matters, not tenure in organization. (Excludes
transfer learning among roles.)</p></li>

<li><p>The power law distribution is characterized by (a=5, max
tenure=10 years).</p></li>
<li><p>There are 5 people involved in the process.</p></li>

<h2 id="exceptions-to-a-process">Exceptions to a Process<span
id="sec:exceptions-to-process"
label="sec:exceptions-to-process"></span></h2>
<p>Process designers are usually motivated to address a specific issue.
When bureaucrats execute a process to support a policy, there may be
cases that violate the designer’s assumptions. Now the person with the
exceptional case and the bureaucrat carrying out the policy have extra
work to deal with the broken process. This is a source of <a
href="#sec:bureaucratic-debt">bureaucratic debt</a>.</p>
<p>When the routine process seem inadequate, there are routes for
exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correct the process to address the exceptional case.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore the task.</p></li>
<li><p>Seek an exception to the process. Exception can be recurring or
one-time. The justification for the exception can be based on social
capital (title, reputation) or be a data driven argument or some mixture
of both.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The designer of a process may not be able to anticipate future
circumstances, but expecting the capacity to be responsive to change is
reasonable. The process designer should use sunset provisions and escape
hatches. A sunset provision can be time-based (this policy expires after
3 years) or based on a threshold (this policy expires after 1000 cases).
An escape hatch specifies the conditions under which the participants
are excepted from the policy.</p>

<p>Deploying a new process in a bureaucratic organization has

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="slowing-deployment-of-processes">Slowing
Deployment of Processes<span id="sec:slow-deployment"
label="sec:slow-deployment"></span></h3>
<p>Three tactics which inhibit deployment of changes within a
bureaucratic organization are stonewalling, slow rolling, and red
herrings.</p>
<p><u>Stonewalling</u> is when the recipient of a request or question
simply doesn’t reply. There are legitimate reasons for a lack of
response. The person may be busy and didn’t see your message, or they
did see your message but didn’t have a chance to reply yet because a
response to you is lower priority than other tasks they have. I’m unable
to differentiate those from when the recipient doesn’t want to enable me
to proceed. They may disagree with my objective and see silence as less
confrontational than explicit rejection.</p>
<p>One way of circumventing stonewalling is to ask if the respondent is
opposed to your idea. Then a lack of response indicates no opposition.
This tactic applies if you are confident the recipient will read or hear
the message.</p>
<p>An unintentional source of stonewalling is when you ask on the wrong
channel. Sending an email may result in what appears to be stonewalling
if the person relies on chat messages or the phone. The solution for
this is for the person who only uses certain channels to explicitly
indicate that. An automatic out-of-office email that says, “Contact me
by phone” tells the sender the preferred channel.</p>
<p>If you need time to think or gather information before responding,
tell the person asking that you acknowledge their message and will
follow up in more detail later (with a specific timeline).</p>
<p><u>Slow rolling</u> is when you get a response to your request or
question, but the response isn’t helpful. There is a delay in the
outcome because you have to iterate to get an answer. There are valid
reasons for a slow roll and there are uncool reasons for a slow roll
response. Perhaps the person wants to acknowledge your request but
doesn’t currently have time to provide a full explanation. The person
may need to gather more information for the complete response. Or the
person may understand your question and does not want to enable your
progress.</p>
<p>The reason for a slow roll should be made explicit by the respondent,
and a timeline for a complete response is helpful.</p>
<p><u>Bikeshedding</u> is when the recipient of a question or request <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">focuses on
unimportant details relative to the primary topic</a>.</p>
<p>A <u>red herring</u> response is misleading, whether intentional or
not. The respondent provides what looks like a reasonable answer but
results in unproductive work. Occasionally there is a coincidental
benefit of discovering something unexpected, but that wasn’t the intent
of the respondent.</p>

then delivers them to Bob’s team. Members of Bob’s team then has to
retype in all the information.</p>
<p>Recently the office went paperless. Now Allen’s team sends Bob’s team
a set of PDF files. Member’s of Bob’s team type in the content from the
PDFs into the database for Bob’s team.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t the organization common to both teams hire a data
scientist to automate the recurring data transfer? Or train the current
staff to learn to program a solution? Or create a third team that
manages a common server?</p>
<p>Because the current staff skill set supports printing and typing data
entry. Training someone with a new skill set takes an investment of
money, time, is an opportunity cost, and makes them a flight risk.
Hiring a data scientist is expensive. Whether the task is feasible is
uncertain, and how long the task will take is uncertain. Even once they
create a connection, then a person with the skill set to maintain it is
needed. The cost of ongoing maintenance and implementation is unknown.
Known working suboptimal with known cost versus unknown potential
improvement of unknown degree for an unknown capital and ongoing cost.

a bill for it from my dentist.</p>
<p>I called my dentist and they explained that the dental insurance had
declined to pay for the procedure. I called the insurance company
January 3 and they confirmed that the procedure was covered by my
policy. Every time I call the insurance provider I had to provide my
social security number, date of birth, and zip code twice – once to the
automated system, a second time to the person I talk with. The insurance
company apparently had made a mistake and said they would cover the cost
of the procedure. I followed up with my dentist and explained the
situation.</p>
<p>I called the dentist to see if they had received payment yet. They
had not, so I called the dental insurance provider again February 6 and
8. February 8 the insurance company said they would process the payment
within 7-10 business days. I called again February 20 and the claim
hadn’t been started within the insurance company. I spoke to the
supervisor and she said she would personally visit the claims office
within the insurance company.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the dentist, they are seeking money for the
service they provided me.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the insurance company, delaying payment on a
claim makes good financial sense – the policy holder is likely to just
pay the balance to avoid going to court with the dentist.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the question is whether chasing this issue makes
financial sense. I think of my hourly rate as $40, so after an hour the
charge of $38 would have been better to pay out of pocket. Effectively
I’m devaluing my time. The emotional stress and thought-cycles spent are
also relevant, though harder to quantify.</p>
<p>Streamlining bureaucratic processes does not occur automatically.
There needs to be both incentive to change and authority to make the
change.</p>

id="deploying-bureaucrats-to-different-teams-or-organizations">Deploying
Bureaucrats to Different Teams or Organizations<span
id="sec:prisoner-exchange" label="sec:prisoner-exchange"></span></h3>
<p>One method of addressing friction between teams or organizations is
to deploy a person. This may not result in a specific change, but it can
help members of both the originating team and receiving team better
understand their counterpart. For the rest of this section I’ll use
“team A" as the origin and “team B” as the receiver, though the concept
applies to exchange of organization members. The name of the bureaucrat
in this example is Mark. This example covers an informal deployment in
which Mark remains employed with team A. While Mark is with team B he
provides the management of team A with a weekly activity report.</p>
<p>The easiest question regarding Mark’s deployment to team B is “how
long?” That depends on the purpose of the exercise and the complexity of
the work Mark will be doing with team B, as well as how long team A can
operate without Mark’s contributions. What is a successful outcome for
Mark? For team A? For team B? For the organization? How long will
integration of Mark onto team B take? Does Mark need time on team A to
delegate current work?</p>
<p>A deployment harms the productivity of originating team A by loss of
staff. The deployment also harms Mark’s productivity for his work with
team A. The deployment harms the receiving team B since they have to
train or integrate Mark.</p>
<p>Incentives for this investment include cross-training for Mark,
better process empathy for both teams, and temporary (exceptional)
support. What is team B expecting from Mark? How will team A benefit?
What is Mark expecting to gain from the deployment? Or is this a
sacrifice on Mark’s part?</p>
<p>Cross-training Mark can improve productivity of Mark and the teams.
Team B gets to hear an outsider’s perspective from Mark, and Mark
returns to team A with a broader perspective of the organization. A
deployment can build relationships among the teams. Both teams are
better able to address process friction or exceptional interactions.</p>
<p>Potential engagement modes for Mark: consultant (providing knowledge
to team B), integree (increasing the capacity of team B), or shadowing
(learning from team B). Shadowing can be of an individual on team B, or
Mark can shadow team B by attending meetings.</p>
<p>Mark could be deployed full time for the entire duration, or split
his him between teams, or build-up/back-down over the course of the
deployment.</p>
<p>Are there criteria for early termination of the deployment? Are there
criteria for extending Mark’s deployment?</p>
<p>If this sounds useful to your team there are a few considerations.
Are you on the originating team A or the receiving team B? Who gets
deployed? How is Mark picked? Was the opportunity advertised? If you’re
receiving Mark, what are your acceptance criteria? How many concurrent
deployments can your team support?</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="service-level-agreements">Service-Level
Agreements<span id="sec:sla" label="sec:sla"></span></h3>
<p>When two teams or two organizations need to interact on a recurring
basis, a formalized approach is to create a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">Service-Level
Agreement</a>. While a Service-Level Agreement (SLA) is constructive for
outlining what each party expects from the other, within a bureaucracy
an SLA is typically not a legally binding contractual agreement. Instead
of a judge resolving disputes, an SLA within a bureaucracy may be
adjudicated by a supervisor common to the two teams.</p>
<p>A Service-Level Agreement within a bureaucracy is dependent on the
good will and honor of the signatories. Since an SLA is a formalization
of a relationship, it is subject to revision when there is turn-over of
signatories in any of the teams.</p>
<p>An Service-Level Agreement should include providing historical and
live data to stakeholders so violations can be measured. The need for
measurements is because enforcement of the SLA is by the signatories.
Observability is key to accountability.</p>
<p>A supervisor common to the parties may be invoked when an SLA is not
met, or if there is a dispute over the interpretation of an SLA. Usually
the threat of invoking oversight is enough to coerce change in
negotiations. When the common supervisor gets involved there are not
many options available for sanctions. The supervisor could withhold
bonuses or promotions, or assign a new team lead, or re-negotiate the
SLA.</p>
<p>Because creation of SLAs are burdensome to all parties invovled,
monitoring to enable enforcement incurs work, and punishment is limited,
most cooperation between teams and between organizations is informal and
ad hoc. Relying on personal relationships is easier than formal
agreements.</p>
<h2 id="tactic-approval-forgiveness-opposition">Tactic: Approval,
Forgiveness, Opposition<span id="sec:approval-forgiveness-opposition"
label="sec:approval-forgiveness-opposition"></span></h2>
<p>A common bureaucratic task is seeking consensus regarding action or
spending resources. There are distinct options about how to get that
consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seek approval before taking action. This approach incurs both
providing justification and waiting.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask forgiveness after taking action. Often viewed as being in
contrast to seeking approval. Less delay, and usually works if things go
well or if no one notices.</p></li>
<li><p>Notification of Intent with deadline for response. The window for
response should be sufficient to actually allow feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Solicit opposition before taking action<a href="#fn58"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>.
This is a different framing from approval or forgiveness. It decreases
the risk the approver has to take on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to proceed depends on the personalities of the people
involved in building consensus and their relationships.</p>
<p>Most organization default to an approval-based processes. Each new
idea needs to be signed off as approved by a sequential list of
bureaucrats. The sequence (not concurrent) process may be known in
advance, or it may be ad hoc if the request is novel.</p>
<p>Relying on approval is harmful to innovation because sign-off by each
bureaucrat is interpreted as “I am 100% in agreement with this.” Each
stakeholder has to bless innovation and tie their reputation to the
outcome.</p>
<p>The “I won’t stop this” (soliciting opposition) is a more useful
paradigm. With the consensus process language changed to “I won’t stop
this," then the bureaucrat can avoid taking responsibility for the idea
and therefore are not tying their reputation to the result.</p>
<h2 id="static-and-dynamic-process">Static and Dynamic Process<span
id="sec:static-dynamic-processes"
label="sec:static-dynamic-processes"></span></h2>
<p>Change within an organization is to be expected since the external
environment the organization exists in is not static. Internal change is
driven by <a href="#sec:turnover">staff turnover</a></p>
<p>and changes of technology. With that premise, why are static
processes that are not robust to change created in the first place?
Answer: so policy creators can point to an effort and avoid looking
neglectful.</p>
<p>Creating robust processes that are dynamic takes more effort to
create. First, the underlying process must be documented. What is
expected to happen? Who are the stakeholders? This logic is fragile to
change. Second, document assumptions used in the process. If the
assumptions are invalidated, then the process is broken and needs to be
discarded or at least revised.</p>
<p>The problem is that even when the process is documented and
assumptions enumerated, they may not be checked to see if revision is
necessary. Measurements need to be periodically taken to see if the
assumptions are still applicable. Another approach is to use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision">sunset
provisions</a> – there is an intent of forcing renewal.</p>
<p>A more quantitative approach is to tie a process to a cost/benefit
model. The benefit to implementing a process comes at some cost. If the
assumptions of the process can be tied to a cost/benefit model, then we
can determine whether the process is worth implementing. Periodic
measurements are needed to update the cost/benefit model and determine
whether the process is effective.</p>
<p>The steps for creating a robust process are</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Document the process that is fragile.</p></li>
<li><p>List assumptions used in the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Relate the assumptions to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit
model</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the measurable parameters of the cost-benefit
model.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect recurring measurements to verify the
assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p>If the assumptions are broken, revise the process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A robust process is just a fragile process with a feedback loop
informed by ongoing measurements.</p>
<h2 id="decisions-and-processes-create-bureaucratic-debt">Decisions and
Processes Create Bureaucratic Debt<span id="sec:bureaucratic-debt"
label="sec:bureaucratic-debt"></span></h2>
<p>Suppose a <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> is enacted and later
found to be ineffective. Some work is needed to revise the process and
hopefully improve effectiveness (or an <a
href="#sec:exceptions-to-process">exception</a> is needed).</p>
<p><span data-acronym-label="bureaucratic debt"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucratic debt</span> is the cost
of the work needed to change a process<a href="#fn59"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>.
The bureaucratic debt is caused by choosing an easy solution now (with
limited information or insufficient resources) instead of using an
approach that would take longer to design and enact.</p>
<p>Decisions occur in a resource constrained environment. Getting
information (measurement) and analysis are costly in terms of money,
time, skill, and labor. Each decision made results in options that are
not explored. These missed opportunities are associated with short-term
versus long-term trade-offs of costs.</p>
<p>The opportunity costs (options the organization doesn’t take) alters
which future decisions become available.</p>
<p>The purpose of defining this concept is to capture the work resulting
from decisions that would otherwise be unaccounted for. Once the concept
of bureaucratic debt is understood it can be tracked.</p>
<p>To document bureaucratic debt, we need to capture decisions as they
are made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the decision to be made?</p></li>
<li><p>When the decision was identified?</p></li>
<li><p>When the decision was made?</p></li>
<li><p>Who made the decision?</p></li>
<li><p>What options were identified?</p></li>
<li><p>Which option was chosen?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was that option was chosen over the other options?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of documenting decisions is to enable both aversion to
bad decisions and attraction to good decisions. Without documenting
decisions, there is no transparency, accountability, or historical
ability to track dependencies.</p>
<p>The documentation of decisions needs to be disseminated to
stakeholders. This should occur as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>For bureaucrats there are the processes and policies which get
applied to customers, the documentation of what those processes and
policies are, and guidance on when the processes and policies should be
applied.</p>
<p>The scale of decision impact determines the level of documentation.
“Do I choose pencil or pen?" incurs negligible bureaucratic debt;
therefore the documentation needed is also negligible. Projecting impact
of decisions is a subjective prediction.</p>
<h2 id="design-processes-for-turnover-of-staff">Design Processes for
Turnover of Staff<span id="sec:turnover"
label="sec:turnover"></span></h2>
<p>When designing a process, there are a few goals to optimize for:
time-to-first-result, average latency, initial financial cost, total
financial cost, flexibility to input conditions, throughput,
scalability. In a theoretical sense all these factors should inform
decision making. An often neglected aspect which is harder to predict
and harder to measure is the importance of employee turnover. On a long
time, scale turnover of bureaucrats is a significant source of risk for
any team or project.</p>
<p>Designing processes relies on roles: participants are treated as
interchangeable with other people who have similar skills. Accounting
for differences in enthusiasm or communication is difficult. Designing
processes that are robust to turn over does not mean ignoring the unique
talents of participants. Emphasize documentation (how and why) and
training of new participants.</p>
<p>Making processes resilient to change requires educated bureaucrats.
That education occurs during on-boarding of the bureaucrat, during the
process, and as bureaucrats exit participation in the process.</p>
<p>On-boarding of new bureaucrats involves technical training,
explanation of norms, learning the processes, and creating a
professional network of coworkers. During this on-boarding the new
bureaucrat should be documenting their observations. Postponing the
creation of documentation until the new person has experience results in
a skewed and incomplete capture of the challenges.</p>
<p>Trained and experienced bureaucrats executing a process are
responsible for coordinating with other bureaucrats. Bureaucrats should
be cross-trained in other roles to gain familiarity with other parts of
a process.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats exiting the team or organization or changing roles have a
responsibility to document their knowledge for team members. An exit
interview can inform how the team improves.</p>
<p>In each phase documentation is the mechanism for spreading knowledge.
Documenting the why (in addition to the how) is critical for the reader.
Access to documentation should be measured to determine whether there is
value to the investment.</p>
<h1 id="skills-of-an-effective-bureaucrat">Skills of an Effective
Bureaucrat<span id="sec:last-chapter"
label="sec:last-chapter"></span></h1>
<p>You could operate within a bureaucracy and entirely focus on just
doing the job you were hired for and ignore administrative distractions.
Or you can be more effective in your job by understanding the role of
engaging with other people – peer bureaucrats, supervisors, and
subjects.</p>
<p>Learning bureaucracy as a skill doesn’t mean you can ignore
personalities of individuals. Bureaucracy as a skill separate from and
in addition to being a good person, being an effective member of a team,
being a good project manager, being a good product owner, skillful
writing, excellent verbal communication skills, applying technical
skills, etc. The distinction from those aspects is that as a bureaucrat
you understand the complications and constraints of your environment and
then can more effectively operate within those conditions.</p>
<p>If you are new to being a bureaucrat, then this book armed you with
understanding your environment. On your first day of employment you are
poised to frame incoming information constructively. If you are an
experienced bureaucrat, it is not too late to improve. Even on your last
day of employment you can learn and be more effective.</p>
<p>In this book I described bureaucracy and provided options for action.
If you are able to apply these generalized perspectives to your specific
situation, you are applying the paradigm developed throughout this book.
Concepts like learning the history of your situation, identifying and
engaging stakeholders to learn their perspective. Brainstorming the
incentives of the individuals involved, and listing what levers they
have for action. What are the dilemmas? Are there feedback loops?</p>
<p>The narrow scope of your role (which hopefully leverages your
education or training) does not capture all relevant aspects of your
job. Based on the definition of <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span>, the critical
aspects of success are having knowledge, sharing your knowledge,
leveraging the knowledge of others, effective communication, working
well with other people, understanding the role of both processes and
social influence, and how those interplay.</p>
<p>The attitude of the effective bureaucrat is that of realistic
optimism. A realistic optimist will occasionally be wrong but makes
progress, whereas a pessimist will be right (because the prediction is
self-fulfilling) but not make progress.</p>

conventional roles in modern society.</p></li>
<li><p>Emergent behavior and being a <a

knowledge for distributed decision making.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucracy occurs when there is a lack of common quantitative
feedback mechanism for individuals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The consequences of thinking like a bureaucrat include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You are not limited to only the direct personal interactions that
you have with other people. Bureaucratic processes that exceed your
direct visibility and experience extend your influence.</p></li>
<li><p>Help you recognize options beyond the naive defaults associated
with <a href="#sec:fallacies">fallacies</a>.</p>
<p>What’s feasible? What’s negotiable? Once you realize rules and

<h2 id="audience-analysis">Audience Analysis</h2>
<p>The primary audience for this book is self-identified novice
bureaucrats and people planning to work in a bureaucracy. The value of
this book is advice beyond “be a good person” and specific to the role
of a bureaucrat, while avoiding adjacent domains like project manager,
team lead, software developer.</p>
<p>The secondary audience is white collar workers who have experience
working in a bureaucracy and are beginning to realize they are
bureaucrats. This audience will find some of the information to be
already known. The value for this audience is a re-framing of the
environment and problems.</p>
<p>The tertiary audience is non-bureaucrats who want to better
understand why bureaucratic systems are challenging. Americans consider
themselves “individuals" and neglect the necessary integration of
operating within a society. This book won’t be a popular best seller,
but it is intended for a lay audience and does not assume prior academic
exposure to the topic.</p>
<p>Lastly, researchers of bureaucracy. This book is not a theoretical
systemic analysis.</p>
