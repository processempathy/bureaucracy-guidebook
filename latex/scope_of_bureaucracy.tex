\section{The Scope of Bureaucracy}
Bureaucracy is a trait of an organization: we call organizations bureaucratic. This is consistent with the definition of bureaucracy based on managing \glspl{shared resource}.  \iftoggle{glossaryinmargin}{\marginpar{[Glossary]}}{}
Examples of organizations considered bureaucratic include:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item The \href{https://www.epa.gov/}{Environmental Protection Agency} (EPA) manages access to bureaucrats who have expertise with environmental regulations governing water, air, workplace safety, etc.

These descriptions of bureaucracy are conceptually consistent but don't provide value to you, the practicing bureaucrat. Bureaucracy is not a distant, faceless concept. Bureaucracy permeates your environment and is the basis for many interactions you have with other people. 

When you recognize bureaucracy specific to your environment, you will be able to respond appropriately. If you recognize the systemic incentives driving a person's behavior, you are less likely to see the person as malicious or incompetent. You are also more likely to be able to negotiate with them and enact the changes that you seek.
