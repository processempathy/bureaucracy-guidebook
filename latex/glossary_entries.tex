\newglossaryentry{shared resource}{
name={shared resource},
plural={shared resources},
description={A community resource -- either tangible items (e.g., land, air, water) or intangible concepts like expertise and information. Access to shared resources is constrained by subjective policies and enforcement. Examples of shared resources:
\begin{itemize}
\item A play put on by actors for an audience. The play is the shared resource; the norms of watching a play are the policies, along with policies set by the theater.
\item A movie in the theater. The norms of watching are enforced by the audience, and the rules of the theater are another source of policy.
\item A road used by cars and trucks and buses.
\item A parking lot -- public or private.
\item You are a shared resource. That applies physically -- you can do manual labor, or mentally -- your attention. You set policies regarding access  like ``I don't work for free.''
\item A kitchen with multiple users.
\item A prison is a bureaucracy; guards are bureaucrats enforcing policy. The shared resource is the space and food and noise of the prison.
\item A viewing platform overlooking a waterfall is a shared resource. Policies are enforced by signs (an artifact of bureaucracy).
\item A server hosting a webpage accessed publicly or only available internally to members of an organization. The subjective policy for access is set by the administrator.
\item Education is a shared resource. Teachers are  bureaucrats.
\item A bulletin board for community announcements is a shared resource. Policies about what can be posted are enforced by the owner.
\item Health care is a shared resource; specifically Doctors and Dentists are experts accessed by the community. Bureaucrats in the health care provider system mediate access.
\item Insurance is a shared resource. Claims adjusters are bureaucrats.
\item A hiking trail is a shared resource.
\item Law enforcement for a safe and just society is a shared resource. Law enforcement officers (e.g., police) are bureaucrats. 
Even though laws are written down (anyone could read them), there's still distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making. No one person knows all the laws. Decisions are made by a sprawling workforce.
\item Judicial system is a shared resource. Judges are bureaucrats.
\item A library space is a shared resource. Librarians are bureaucrats.
\item Books in a library are a shared resource. Librarians are bureaucrats.
\item In education, the teacher is the shared resource. 
\item In the military, the warfighter is a shared resource. The equipment (tanks, guns, planes, boats) is the shared resource.
\item A church is a shared resource among the congregation.
\item Religion is a bureaucracy premised on the constraint of finite expertise concerning what God wants you to do. The shared resource is the expert's knowledge.
\item A stairwell is a shared resource. Example policy: don't sleep in the stairwell; don't sell items in the stairway. Here the bureaucrats are the building manager and the fire marshal. 
\item A hallway used by renters in a multi-unit building or used by hotel guests.
\item A house for a family. For example, a policy of taking your shoes off when you enter. The bureaucrat is the homeowner.
\item Parks -- public (city, county, state, national) or private (e.g., paid access). 
\item Safety of passengers on a plane, bus, or train; quiet, no strong smells, no flashing lights.
\item Safety of cars and trucks on a road. 
\end{itemize}
Private or public is irrelevant; commercial or non-profit is irrelevant. \\
Bureaucracies typically manage more than one shared resource.
As an example, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_transportation}{Department of Transportation}
\index{exemplar!\string\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_transportation}{Department of Transportation}}
manages  transit systems like roads and railways, the expertise to manage those resources, and money to fund the development and maintenance of transit systems}
