\section{How to Reduce Administrative Overhead\label{sec:reducing-overhead}}

You can read this list from a position of authority to take action, or you can read this list as an advocate for improvement.

In isolation, none of these ideas should be surprising. Enacting each idea requires ongoing investment. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Tip}: Automate recurring decision processes. Automation can decrease work and decrease the risk of inconsistent outcomes. Automation is a way of encoding bureaucratic processes that involve subjective decisions into repeatable steps.
\item \textit{Tip}: Where automation is infeasible for a process involving multiple bureaucrats, make advocates with end-to-end authority available to the subject. 
This improves the subject's experience of a process. A benefit to the organization is that the advocate might see opportunities for improvement not apparent to a bureaucrat responsible for one step in the process.
\item \textit{Tip}: Make processes transparent to participants. 
This improves the subject's understanding of a process. Transparency can help with trustworthiness if the reasoning for actions is defensible.
\item \textit{Tip}: Make information discoverable (e.g., via search engine).
\item \textit{Tip}: Make information directly available, rather than mediated by a person. 
\item \textit{Tip}: After an interaction is completed, summarize the steps and outcome for the participant. 
\item \textit{Tip}: When a process fails the needs of a participant, investigate the failure and improve the process\footnote{See the Wikipedia entry on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process}{Continual improvement process}}. 
\item \textit{Tip}: Make the goals and priorities of the organization clear to all stakeholders. This enables accountability by allowing a participant to point to dissonance.  
\item \textit{Tip}: Define measurable standards of performance, both for individual bureaucrats and for teams. Again, accountability is a feedback loop that needs a starting point for identifying dissonance.
\item \textit{Tip}: Train bureaucrats how to engage participants effectively; these interactions determine the culture of an organization. 
\item \textit{Tip}: Train bureaucrats by addressing their immediate problems (e.g., through mentorship).
\item \textit{Tip}: Make employment desirable to people who have desirable characteristics (e.g., educated candidates).
\item \textit{Tip}: Enhance accountability to peers (e.g., peer review of actions and outcomes).
\item \textit{Tip}: Make sure that incentives for organizations and individual people encourage improvement rather than maintenance of status quo.
\item \textit{Tip}: Decision making should be pushed down the hierarchy to the practitioner~\cite{2013_Marquet}.
\item \textit{Tip}: When decision making requires cross-organization interaction, form a team of practitioners.
\item \textit{Tip}: Supervisors should share workload with their team to gain practical exposure to current challenges.
\item \textit{Tip}: Seek feedback from process participants; then provide status updates on the implementation of changes. This provides a feedback loop and is a form of accountability.

\item \textit{Tip}: Replace sequential approval chains with a concurrent review process. Sequential approval reduces the number of ideas reaching later approvers by filtering good ideas as well as bad ideas. Approvers may perform independent (redundant) due diligence and end up disagreeing.
