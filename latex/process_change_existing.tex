\section{Change Existing Processes\label{sec:change-a-process}}

Processes change over time because the conditions change. When a bureaucratic process is no longer providing value to the organization or the participants, change is needed. 

Changing complex processes is hard because individuals involved in the process may depend on steps that are not visible to other people.

Making change more complicated is the entanglement of inter-dependent processes. Processes do not exist in isolation\footnote{\href{https://www.hyrumslaw.com/}{https://www.hyrumslaw.com/}}. % https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29848295

When change to processes is attempted, change is slow to happen because of lag in feedback loops. 

\subsection*{Bureaucratic Inertia}

Creating an organization, recruiting staff, getting funding, getting office space, setting up communication technologies, and creating processes is a significant investment of time and money and people. 
That same work applies when making changes to the size and scope of an organization (making it larger or smaller). 
Because this work and attention take time, there is a lag associated with changes to an organization that better reflect the scope of tasks and the number of tasks. 
The lag of changes as they ripple through an organization characterize \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic_inertia}{bureaucratic inertia}. 
\index{Wikipedia!\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic_inertia}{bureaucratic inertia}}

At a more personal scale, the causes of bureaucratic inertia are attributable to changes to processes or creating new processes. A process displaces the need for bureaucrats to think, so new processes force bureaucrats to think about their roles or develop new skills. 


%Seemingly simple tasks like buying pens incurs significant overhead of work and time. 

Another source of bureaucratic inertia is the over-subscription of tasks to the amount of attention available and resources available. In the situation where there isn't enough resources or attention, then the response to some tasks is necessarily delayed or left unaddressed. Delayed tasks block the workflows that depend on those outcomes.

\subsection*{Why Change a Process}

Why changes to a process occur in a bureaucratic organization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To make an improvement to an existing processes that are working as desired (i.e., a more clever solution).
    \item Improving an existing process by undoing mistakes previously made.
    \item Inventing a new process where there previously was not one.
    \item If utility and improvement are difficult to quantify bureaucratic activities, then bureaucrats may be promoted based on change instead of whether value was delivered.
\end{itemize}

If you recognize that processes are evolutionary, then the right response is to allow and look for iterative change (fail fast) rather than trying to create static processes.

\subsection*{How to Change a Process}

Change to a process can come from the top of the organization hierarchy or from the bottom. 

When change is driven from the top-down,
\textit{benefit}: unified vision enables global optimization.\\
\textit{inefficiency}: can't see all the details from the top, so solutions may not fit well.\\
\textit{resolution}: better reporting up the chain.

When change is driven from the bottom up,
\textit{benefit}: each component in the hierarchy has local control, sees local aspects, and creates solutions for the local problem.\\
\textit{inefficiency}: local optimization across multiple components in a workflow can yield suboptimal outcomes.\\
\textit{resolution}: each local component acts with same objective

Regardless of where you are in the hierarchy there generally applicable tips for changing a process. The first is to segment the stakeholders, and the second is to find critical \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop}{OODA loops},
\index{Wikipedia!\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop}{OODA loop}} and the third is to alter how you notify stakeholders.

\subsection*{Tactic: Segment Stakeholders}

A bureaucratic process is a workflow of tasks carried out by people in different roles. To be more effective in enacting change, a useful tactic is to 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation}{segment}
\index{Wikipedia!\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation}{Market segmentation}}
your stakeholders into groups. 
\begin{itemize}
 \item People interested in active collaboration. They may not share your zeal, but finding shared activities is helpful for participation.
    \item People who passively support the activity but do not provide resources. May provide feedback or enlarge the coalition.
    \item People who don't care and are not engaged.
    \item People who disagree with you. Seek these contrarians out to refine the idea or scope. Negotiate!
    \item People who are actively working against you. Try to understand their motives. Not through speculation, but by direct discussion. Written communication is inadequate. 
\end{itemize}

Which segment a person is part of changes as your scope and timeline shifts. Their activities and priorities may cause their position to evolve.

% How to change
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Humans use \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop}{OODA loops}.
    \index{Wikipedia!\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop}{OODA loop}}
    \item To change an organization, change the OODA loops of participants.
    \item Not all humans are equally important in an organization. For that reason, surveys may be misleading. Organizations typically have a few dominant participants -- the mavens. These people may or may not be leaders in the organization.
    \item Use a social implementation of Page Rank to find the relevant participants. In a one-on-one interaction, ask the person who they would recommend talking to.
``Who else would you recommend talking to about this topic?" is the last question in the first conversation.
To start this search process, simply start with your first-order social connections. Cover both low-level participants and the chain of command.
\end{enumerate}

Leverage the trust already in the social network by starting conversations with ``When I spoke with Bob he recommended I talk to you about $<$name of topic$>$."
