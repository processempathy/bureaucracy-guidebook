When a decision has two viable options (neither being best), that presents a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma}{dilemma}. The name for a decision with three viable options is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma}{trilemma}. This section describes a bureaucrat's experience of operating within an organization in terms of dilemmas and trilemmas. Instead of focusing on moral dilemmas (see~\cite{2017_Zacka}) or institutional ethics, here I focus on interpersonal relationships and the logistics of allocating attention. 
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning

%Dilemma are not unique to bureaucracy. 
Dilemmas are a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning}{simple way} of discussing decisions. % but are not the only relevant aspect of bureaucracy.
Dilemmas are a useful framing to highlight the following concepts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item You, an individual bureaucrat, face decisions that you may not have recognized. Failing to recognize a choice (an error by omission) can lead to suboptimal results. The dilemmas below are generic to any bureaucratic process and are intended to stimulate your ability to identify decisions. 
    \item You face complex trade-offs in your role as a bureaucrat. Dilemmas are intended an entry point to more nuanced reflection that is specific to your situation. The dilemmas below are not exhaustive; this list is merely illustrative. 
    \item You can use dilemmas as an entry to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind}{intellectual empathy} with fellow bureaucrats when you recognize they face the same dilemmas. These dilemmas are generic to the situation and the person facing the decisions. You now have a topic to discuss with them. You can share your understanding. 
    \item You can be curious about the choice other bureaucrats select for a given dilemma. Everyone in the organization faces these decisions, so these dilemmas give you a topic of conversation to better understand each bureaucrat's view.
    \item You can identify and negotiate potential sources of friction. Other bureaucrats may arrive at different selections for a given dilemma, so recognizing this and discussing it can improve the effectiveness of all involved.
\end{itemize}


% claim
Dilemmas explain the inherent complexity of bureaucracy even when bureaucrats are honest and the purpose of the organization is clear.
% relevance
The point isn't that one should \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma}{select one of the two options}. The point of recognizing a dilemma is that it is a marker that there is a decision to be made.
% consequence
Once the need for a decision is identified, the action for the bureaucrat is not to select one of the two options. The effective bureaucrat identifies nuances, enumerates alternatives, and talks with fellow bureaucrats about these decisions. Rather than seeking consensus, strive for comprehension of other people's perspective. That way you can navigate decision making processes more effectively.

The choices described below in the simplified representation of dilemmas are intended as a starting point for introducing the decision space relevant to individual bureaucrats. Do not accept the dilemmas presented here as the final framing. Thinking in terms of a limited spectrum of opportunities neglects nuances that enable more creative approaches. 
Awareness of these dilemmas and trilemmas are intended to spark creative imagination about the nuances specific to your situation.

By recognizing the deficiencies of dilemmas, you can identify nuances specific to the situation you are in. Instead of responding to the recognition of a decision with ``should I do this or that?'' the better option is to assess the complexities and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming}{brainstorm} multiple options. Talk with stakeholders and understand the history of the situation before making a choice.



\subsection*{How Dilemmas Arise in Bureaucracy}

Given a task, the simplest response for an individual is to take action and be done. There wasn't a decision needed.

If the task is more challenging then first make a plan and then take action and be done. The source of the challenge may be task complexity, scale, number of people effected, diversity of stakeholders, amount of time needed, how the current task shapes future options, number of collaborators. Regardless of why the task is challenging, a dilemma has already arisen: how much time to spend planning versus doing. 

If the task is even more challenging, it may be useful to gather data for the plan, then make a plan, then take action and be done. A new dilemma arises: how much time to spend gathering data versus planning. The previous dilemma still exists -- how much time to invest in planning versus doing. As an alternative to the dilemma framing, how much time should be allocated to three categories of activity?

But wait, how did the person in the first scenario (just do the task) know no plan was necessary? Either it was an explicit choice or they didn't perceive the need to decide about whether to plan. Someone else faced with that same task might choose differently, e.g., to make a plan. The task complexity is relative to the person's skills, experiences, expectations about stakeholders, and potential ramifications.

In this escalating sequence of increasingly challenging tasks, now suppose the task involves you and another person. The overhead of coordination inflicts other dilemmas. The examples of complexity arising from coordination are identified in the list of dilemmas below, e.g. \ref{table:micromanaging}, \ref{table:early-intervention}.

An independent source of friction for distributed decision making and distributed knowledge is when people involved in the task don't agree on how challenging it is. The framing of the difficulty matters because it can lead different participants to distinct conclusions about how much time should be spent planning versus for carrying out the action. The choice of ``how complicated is the task?'' shapes the team dynamics and informs the need for hierarchical roles. 

\subsection*{Folk Wisdom on Decision Making}

Bureaucrats, whether hired for their expertise or simply to provide labor, are rarely experts on decision making. There are multiple domains in which \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory}{decision making} is studied (e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory}{economics}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory}{mathematics}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making}{psychology}), but practicing bureaucrats are more likely familiar with colloquialisms that feel descriptive. A few are provided here to give a sense of both the conciseness and the lack of action embedded in each meme.

\ \\

Each of these memes feel descriptive to the practicing bureaucrat. They survive because of their self-encapsulation; no more thought needed.

In comparison to the folk expressions above, dilemmas are intended to be accessible to practicing bureaucrats and trigger reflection and discussion. Effective action is enabled by improved understanding of the trade-offs faced within an organization. Rather than being reductive, the purpose of cataloging bureaucratic dilemmas is to first point out that there is a choice. Once the choice is recognized, look for ways to think beyond the dichotomy.

\subsection*{How Dilemmas Oversimplify}

Although the following concepts are presented as dilemmas and trilemmas, these are necessarily simplifications. For example, two ways to simplify situations into a dilemma are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start with a single variable, e.g., ``how much data gathering", and force it into a binary choice ``more data gathering" versus ``less data gathering."
    
    % a reduction of a complicated situation to one variable. 
    \item Start with a complex trade-off space with many opportunities and reduce it to a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma}{false dichotomy} of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_thinking}{zero-sum options}: ``more data gathering" vs ``more planning." The actual trade-space involves optimization of multiple goals, like (maximize productivity) and (minimize unnecessary risk) and (maximize quality) and (maximize employee satisfaction) and (minimize latency). 
    % https://bennorthrop.com/Essays/2022/code-ownership-stewardship-or-free-for-all.php
\end{itemize}
The over-simplifications listed below neglect both the continuous nature of the trade-offs and the alternative creative approaches to a specific situation. 

%\subsection*{Dilemmas as a Framing to Ease you into Complexity}



Ponder these dilemmas prior to the pressure of real-time decision making.  Recognize dilemmas and trilemmas and then extend your analysis beyond them by adapting to the local conditions and specific people available to help.
Dilemmas should not be resolved alone. Talk with subordinates,peers, mentors, supervisor.


Once a dilemma is recognized, it is easier to defer and avoid the  decision making process\footnote{\href{https://xkcd.com/1445/}{https://xkcd.com/1445/}\index{xkcd!\href{https://xkcd.com/1445/}{1445}}}. Therefore implementation takes longer necessary. 
This delay is then ripples down the chain of dependencies. 

\subsection*{Dilemmas are not Purely Intellectual}
Decision making is not a purely intellectual task; there is emotional stress induced by the process. Dilemmas create cognitive dissonance for the decision maker. Any selection is going to have downsides, and any compromise will be suboptimal. Those burdens weigh morally on deciders because of the consequences on other people.

To counter this morale weight, talk with other people about decisions. 
\marginpar{[Tag] Actionable Advice}
Even if this does not alleviate the responsibility of deciding, discussion can help you arrive at new insights. 

\subsection*{More Complications}
Adding to the difficulty and stress, dilemmas presented here occur concurrently and continuously. The dilemmas are inter-dependent due to both to the common variables and the constrained resources.
Selecting an option for one dilemma alters the options available in other dilemmas.

Oscillation between approaches can be caused by change of management, accumulation of experience (dissatisfaction) with one solution, the desire for promotion within the hierarchy (where change is presented as progress), or a desire for cost savings (efficiency). The rate of oscillation is an indicator of the half-life of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_memory}{institutional memory for an organization}.  

The dilemmas identified below for generic bureaucracy are just a baseline. For the culture you are in and the project you're working on and the people you're working with, there will be more dilemmas to identify. 

\ \\

The following two sections categorize dilemmas as \hyperref[sec:personal-policy-dilemmas]{personal policies} 
%\iftoggle{sectionref}{%

(section~\ref{sec:personal-policy-dilemmas}) 
\fi
%}
and policies regarding \hyperref[sec:org-dilemma]{structure of the organization}.
%\iftoggle{sectionref}{%
\ifsectionref
(section~\ref{sec:org-dilemma}). 
\fi
%}
The personal policies apply to each bureaucrat in an organization, while the structural policies for an organization are faced by a subset of bureaucrats in the management role. 

\subsection*{Personal Policy Dilemmas \label{sec:personal-policy-dilemmas}}

In practice, the following decisions are unordered and are constantly faced by the bureaucrat. As observed by Lindblom in~\cite{1959_Lindblom}, this flurry of decisions contrasts to a regularized process that might be envisioned as optimal.

\textit{Dilemma of Aperture.}
\index{dilemma!of aperture}
Scope of problem solving can be narrow or broad. Rather than limit your investigations to one or the other, flipping between the two on a recurring basis (but not too often) can help.
}
\label{table:focus-vs-systemic}
\end{table}
\end{center}

The \href{table:focus-vs-systemic}{Dilemma of Aperture} is defined in terms of scope. An adjacent dilemma is the question of duration of tasks: short-term or long-term. The right balance of how long tasks take is more project management then bureaucratic. I try to identify a small number of long-term tasks, then divide each into smaller (shorter) tasks. The dependencies of the smaller tasks then determine the order of the work.

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
The \href{table:focus-vs-systemic}{Dilemma of Aperture} is not specific to bureaucracy, but commonly arises because isolated problems rarely exist. Challenges occur as part of larger systemic contexts. Addressing the immediate problem leaves the system issue, and tackling system issues are more difficult. 

% How does this affect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
Your selection of narrow versus wide within the \href{table:focus-vs-systemic}{Dilemma of Aperture} depends on what you find emotionally rewarding. Other bureaucrats may gain emotional enjoyment from approaches to problem solving that you do not. Finding ways to leverage that difference (rather than minimizing it) is useful. 

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
Organizations typically incentivize short-term behavior. Annual performance reviews and quarterly feedback cycles might miss systemic changes that take multiple years to enact. Identifying incremental milestones is one response, though that isn't always feasible. Another approach is to only report a subset of your activities (the ones that yield short-term results).

\end{table}
\end{center}

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
The \href{table:speak-up-or-hold-back}{Dilemma of Speaking} arises in bureaucracy because different people have different opinions about subjective policy. You may see someone doing something that appears wasteful, but that may be because you're not aware of what the optimization objective is. Or that person may be unaware of the waste, or they may not be aware there is a more effective way to carry out the action. 

Resolving differences of opinion is not always necessary. If all members of and organization were to try to minimize policy distinctions, the members could spend all of their time doing so. 

% How does this affect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
The \href{table:speak-up-or-hold-back}{Dilemma of Speaking} is eased when you have relationships with other bureaucrats that allow you to express your curiosity or uncertainty in a way that doesn't make the person you are talking to feel threatened, or that they are wasting their time explaining what seems obvious. 

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
Whether the culture of an organization promotes speaking up or not depends on having either top-down encouragement or relationships that exist outside formal hierarchical roles.

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
When there is an objective measure for success, suggestions can be evaluated with respect to whether change improves the outcome. Because bureaucracy is based on subjective policy, there are always differences about how to improve. The \href{table:early-intervention}{Dilemma of Early Intervention} is about knowledge your role didn't require. That knowledge may be incomplete or you may know more than the people taking action. 


% How does this effect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
The \href{table:early-intervention}{Dilemma of Early Intervention} can harm your relationships if you are seen as exceeding your role. Your action can benefit the organization, and the team taking the action may be grateful for the intervention. 

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
Because organizations promote individuals, and there are a limited number of promotions available, the naive expectation is that intervention that could benefit others and risks harming your relationships would not happen. The motive for an individual to intervene is the displeasure of watching other people waste time and resources, or the possibility to learn something new.

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
\href{table:micromanaging}{Micromanagement from the supervisor's view} is not unique to bureaucratic organizations. The tendency to micromanage does not depend on the level of technical expertise of the manager. Micromanagement occurs when the manager feels insecure about results. If the employees are untrained or unmotivated, the sense of insecurity may be reasonable.

% How does this effect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
Limiting \href{table:micromanaging}{micromanagement from the supervisor's view} means finding an acceptable level of engagement. This depends on the training and motivation of each participant. 

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
The manager is accountable for the outcome of the people being supervised, which leads the manager to fear that underlings will fail.  Contrast this with the Dilemma of  \hyperref[table:solution-provider]{micromanagement from the subordinate’s view}.

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
\href{table:solution-provider}{Micromanagement from the subordinate's view} is based on expectations the bureaucrat has for their supervisor. Micromanagement is common in bureaucracy due to the defining aspect of subjective decision making; delegating policy enforcement is a loss of control. 

% How does this effect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
Regardless of origin, \href{table:solution-provider}{micromanagement from the subordinate's view} harms each person's emotional state and sours relationships. This impedes your role as an effective bureaucrat no matter the cause.

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
Happily, this dilemma can be remedied by talking with the other people involved in the situation. Each person has to be willing to express their concerns and to adapt their behavior.

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
Bureaucracy is based on subjective decision making about policy enforcement. The \href{table:notes_or_no_notes}{Dilemma of Documentation} is a question whether you avoid risk of accountability or enable accountability of yourself and other bureaucrats. Having a written record is very useful when confronted with the question, ``What did you know and when did you know it?"

% How does this effect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
If you decide to respond to the \href{table:notes_or_no_notes}{Dilemma of Documentation} by taking notes and sharing them, your coworkers get value from your notes. Your investment saves them time and allows them to search through old notes.

As a new member of a team, this is an easy way to provide value.  

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
A limiting factor biasing a bureaucrat towards the ``no documentation'' extreme is the ability to take good notes during or after conversations. That can be limited by ability to multi-task (listen and write), or memory of what was said, or hand-writing. Another bottleneck is the time needed for writing notes.

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
The \href{table:forest-vs-trees}{Dilemma of Think or Do} is pervasive in bureaucracy. Any time not spent taking action looks wasteful, while investing too little thought can result in wasteful action. 

% How does this effect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
Coordinating with other bureaucrats magnifies the challenge. If different bureaucrats allocate different amounts of time to planning and acting, then each person interrupts others. This is unavoidable. Effective bureaucrats default to early coordination instead of waiting to see how others respond.

The \href{table:forest-vs-trees}{Dilemma of Think or Do} applies at the scale of individual bureaucrats and to the collective behavior of teams and organizations. The time it takes a team to respond is longer than that of an individual, and the time an organization takes is longer than that of a team.  A common mistake is to apply the timescale relevant to an individual to a team or organization.

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
Inaction is usually a safe response to a situation. Admiring the problem, studying the options, or continuing to work on other issues are common behaviors. Only when circumstances threaten relationships or the team or organization is action taken.

When you first hear of a challenge, you may be interested in immediately tackling it. You see a path to improvement, you have the skills needed, and addressing the challenge would benefit your team. Unbeknownst to you, another person on another team saw that same challenge and had the same reaction. 

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
Because of the distributed nature of knowledge and decision making in bureaucracy, the \href{table:meetings-versus-work}{Dilemma of Coordinate or Do}
is happening all the time for many aspect of the subjective decisions being made. Advertising ``I'm going to do something" and ``I'm doing something" and ``I did something" as you are progressing on any given task is vital to decreasing the likelihood of unintentional duplication. Even that activity of advertising and listening to the advertisements of other bureaucrats takes time away from doing your work. 

% How does this effect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
The \href{table:meetings-versus-work}{Dilemma of Coordinate or Do} is a cause of conflict among bureaucrats who prioritize doing the work versus bureaucrats who see value in checking in with others first. The constraint of time allocation and variety of views leads to friction in organizations.

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
As with \href{table:forest-vs-trees}{Dilemma of Think or Do}, inaction is the safer default. Having a meeting is less risky than investing time in creating a prototype.

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
Just as there are two views of micromanagement (\ref{table:solution-provider} and \ref{table:micromanaging}), promotion can be seen from the supervisor's view and the subordinate's view. The \href{table:work_extra_or_work_as_expected}{Dilemma of Working extra hard} is the view of the subordinate. Unlike jobs in which labor that are directly tied to financial profit, a bureaucrat has a weak feedback loop for their labor. Promotion may (but is not guaranteed to) happen in the future based on your current level of effort. 

% How does this effect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
The \href{table:work_extra_or_work_as_expected}{Dilemma of Working extra hard} creates competition among bureaucrats competing for a limited pool of promotions. Because organizations rely on hierarchy, and hierarchy is correlated with pay, promotion is typically not based purely on the merits of an individual bureaucrat. 

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
Promotions exist to bias bureaucrats towards the ``extra labor for reduced wages" outcome. Bureaucrats who have sufficient income and autonomy may not see promotions as relevant and thus be comfortable at their current workload. There are other \hyperref[sec:motivations]{motivations} driving bureaucrats besides pay, such as working towards a vision or gaining new skills.

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
The \href{table:bad-news-up-the-chain}{Dilemma of Bad News} is a consequence of hierarchical reporting in organizations. Regardless of whether the hierarchy stems from specialization of skills or delegation of decisions, information traverses up the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy}{chain of command}. 

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
News going up the chain of command is subject to modifications -- both filtering and embellishment. Filtering out bad news or making the report more grandiose can be spun as contextualization. Which outcome is preferred depends on the specific of the people reading the reports. Whether to report an update is one choice, how to spin it is another. Did the team fail to accomplish their objective, or did the team learn something that will inform the next phase of their progress?


% How does this effect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
The \href{table:bad-news-up-the-chain}{Dilemma of Bad News} applies to peer-to-peer relations and supervisor-to-subordinate, but in those two relationships the repercussions of bad news are less. Being professionally vulnerable feels safer when there is less at risk.

% How does this relate directly to bureaucracy as defined as shared resource management policymaking?
Bureaucracy arises to manage a shared resource, and there are emergencies regardless of the specific resource. Emergencies can be on the supply side, like problems with air quality or not enough food inspectors. Disasters on the demand side come in the form of sudden spikes. The  \href{table:emergencies-vs-ignore}{Dilemma of Preparation versus Cleanup} cannot be avoided. 

% Are the incentive structures aligned to support one direction or the other?
There is a bias favoring the reactionary cleanup mentality. Bureaucrats appear responsive to the needs of the situation. Planning for an emergency requires thinking about contingencies. 

% How does this effect your relationships with other bureaucrats?
Even when there is consensus around the value of preparation, the follow-on question is to what degree.

The logistics of gathering data can be measured, but there are other subjective aspects to account for as well. Making a decision has an emotional toll on the decider due to the risk of failure. Also, decisions are made in a social context, with decision makers accounting for the ramifications on people they have relationships with.

Making a decision imposes a bound on how much time is available for both gathering data and planning. Time is zero sum, so more time gathering data is less time planning. Similarly, the number of people available for data gathering and planning is bounded, and tasking people is a zero sum choice.

Centralization is often carried out for the purposes of cost efficiency. The cost savings are due to de-duplication and having less slack. Both of those ``savings'' are a decrease of redundancy, which has a cost when there are unexpected fluctuations in need. 

Centralization is an intentional monopolization, with the corresponding decrease in choices. 
Centralization (de-localization) can decrease the value assigned to feedback from people using the service because personal relations are de-valued. 

The weaker feedback, lack of redundancy, and decreased emphasis on relationships motivates the creation of local services.

There is a Goldilocks situation for amount of processes in an organization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Too few processes (all social relationships).
    \item Just the right amount -- a balance process and social, and when to use which is known.
    \item Too much process (not enough leveraging of social relationships)
\end{itemize}
This optimization is like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve}{Laffer curve} in economics.

\textit{Trilemma}: \textbf{Do you support the cutting edge, most of the middle, or the laggards?}\\
\index{trilemma!cutting edge, middle, laggards}
For any given aspect of bureaucracy there is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution}{bell curve} of skills and interest of bureaucrats. In your role of bureaucrat you face a choice: find and collaborate with and enable the best and brightest, or aim your efforts at the massive mediocre middle (most bureaucrats), or try to get the dumbest bureaucrats up to speed? 

Trying to escape the trilemma by claiming that you treat everyone equally means you are disregarding the needs of the tail of the distribution.

\textit{Trilemma}: \textbf{Do you work for your team, your manager, or yourself?} \\
\index{trilemma!team, manager, yourself}
Being a member of a team that operates within a hierarchy is tough. One reason is the question of who you are working for. The trilemma is whether you work for yourself, work for your supervisor, or work for your team.  Ideally you can find ways to do all three, but that is not always the case. 

Members of the team should work collaboratively, but there is a potential counter-force: accountability to the supervisor. Because each team member is accountable to their supervisor(s), that motivates the action of the individual. The team does not actually have autonomy -- they are accountable to the boss.

In the approach ``team members are directed by their supervisor," the synergy of the team is neglected and the supervisor becomes a bottleneck (for decision making and for creativity and for planning).

The third approach is for a person to ignore their team and their supervisor. This might enable quicker progress, at the risk of going in an unhelpful direction or not leveraging skills of coworkers. 

\ \\

\textit{Trilemma}:
\textbf{Seek less budget, same, or larger budget.} 
\index{trilemma!less, same, or larger budget}
Less budget is needed if you improved efficiency, but then the proportional power within the organization is decreased. A larger budget may be due to inefficiency or growth. Keeping the same budget indicates no promotions are relevant (although a steady state could result from a combination of growth and improved efficency). 

\ \\

A trilemma applicable to many situations is that options are \textbf{fast, inexpensive, good; choose two}. 
\index{trilemma!fast, inexpensive, good}
(This is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle}{Project management triangle}.) \\
\index{folk wisdom!\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle}{Project management triangle}}
In other words, the options are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Good and fast is expensive (i.e., requires lots of resources).
    \item Good and inexpensive takes a long time (i.e., find a clever solution).
    \item Fast and inexpensive will be low quality.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Consequences of the Dilemma-based Framing}

There are many dilemmas listed above but that is not exhaustive. Even if each bureaucrat considers the same choices (which doesn't necessarily happen), not everyone makes the same selection. One response might be to defer to someone higher in the hierarchy to coordinate. While this would ensure consistency, this would be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement}{micromanagement}. The people in the hierarchy above the person facing the choice don't have exposure to the problem. Choices are delegated to leverage expertise. 

\ \\

When you are facing these dilemmas and trilemmas
\marginpar{[Tag] Actionable Advice} 
there are constructive responses that can improve your effectiveness. Improvement benefits your results, your reputation, and the organization. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collect quantitative data for each variable. Quantitative arguments can augment qualitative stories. 
    \item Construct the Pareto frontier to identify non-optimal choices that can be eliminated.
    \item Instead of assessing variables in isolation, assess consequences in the context of workflows and effects on stakeholders.
    \item Discuss subjective decisions with stakeholders so that potential disagreements can be negotiated instead of creating friction.
\end{itemize}
