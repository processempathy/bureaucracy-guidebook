\subsection*{Roles of Management versus Leadership}

\index{mantra!management isn't leadership}
Teams include managers and leaders. Those roles are not necessarily filled by the same person. By clarifying the distinction, you can determine what to expect from various members of the hierarchy. A common mistake is to expect leadership from managers. 

A manager's role involves time management, task tracking, employee evaluations, promotion, pay, requesting resources for team members, and hiring. Sometimes the responsibilities of promotion, pay, and hiring are split into a supervisor role, leaving task tracking and time management to the project manager or product manager roles.

A leader's role focuses on coordinating vision and principles. The vision and principles do not have to originate from the leader -- other team members can contribute ideas. The leader's responsibility is primarily social consensus and aligning the goals of members.
