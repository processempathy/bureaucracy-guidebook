\section{Design of Processes\label{sec:design-of-processes}}

Bureaucracy is the use of distributed knowledge and distributed decision making for policies concerning access to shared resources. To enact this concept a set of \glspl{process} is used by \glspl{bureaucrat} to leverage specialization and improve throughput. 
    
Because bureaucrats are typically not formally trained in designing processes, ad hoc ideas reactive to the immediate situation and local constraints are used. A thoughtful process designer attempts to account for exceptions (page~\pageref{sec:exceptions-to-process}) and potential mistakes (page~\pageref{sec:process-mistakes}).

The following sections describe why static process designs are the norm, the role of bureaucratic debt, and how to design for turnover of staff.
