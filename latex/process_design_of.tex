Deployment of processes need to account for 
normal users, power users, malicious users, and edge cases.

When designing a process, look for ways to minimize the work for people involved. Minimizing work (both physical and mental) for the people involved means less sensitivity to entropy in a bureaucracy. Minimizing work requires significant situational awareness on the part of the designer. To minimize effect on existing bureaucracy, it's vital to minimize the requirements to achieve success.

Bureaucracy is the use of distributed knowledge and distributed decision making for policies concerning access to shared resources. A set of \glspl{process} is used by \glspl{bureaucrat} to leverage specialization and improve throughput. 
    
Because bureaucrats are typically not formally trained in designing processes, ad hoc ideas reactive to the immediate situation and local constraints are used. A thoughtful process designer attempts to account for exceptions (page~\pageref{sec:exceptions-to-process}) and potential mistakes (page~\pageref{sec:process-mistakes}).

The following sections describe why static process designs are the norm, the role of bureaucratic debt, and how to design for turnover of staff.
