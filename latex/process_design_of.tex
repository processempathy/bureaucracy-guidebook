\section{Design of Processes\label{sec:design-of-processes}}




Bureaucracy is the use of distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making for policies concerning access to shared resources. A set of \iftoggle{glossarysubstitutionworks}{\glspl{process}}{processes}
\marginpar{[Tag] Glossary}
is used by \iftoggle{glossarysubstitutionworks}{\glspl{bureaucrat}}{bureaucrats} to leverage specialization and improve throughput. 
    
Because bureaucrats are typically not formally trained in designing processes, ad hoc ideas reactive to the immediate situation and local constraints are used. A thoughtful process designer attempts to account for exceptions \iftoggle{haspagenumbers}{ (page~\pageref{sec:exceptions-to-process})}{} and potential mistakes\iftoggle{haspagenumbers}{ (page~\pageref{sec:process-mistakes}).}{.}

The most effective process is a minimal process.
When designing a process, look for ways to minimize the work for people involved. Minimizing work (both physical and mental) for the people involved means less sensitivity to entropy in a bureaucracy. Minimizing work requires significant situational awareness on the part of the designer. To minimize effect on existing bureaucracy, it's vital to minimize the requirements to achieve success.

Another question to ask when designing a bureaucratic process is whether a process is actually needed. Can the goal be accomplished relying on ad hoc responses and leverage relationships among bureaucrats?

There is a Goldilocks situation for number of processes in an organization:
\marginpar{[Tag] \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle}{Goldilocks balance}}
\index{Goldilocks balance!number of processes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Too few processes (all social relationships). New participants, lacking necessary relationships, find the team or organization chaotic. 
    \item Just the right amount -- a balance process and social, and when to use which is known. Each participant  has a different view about what the right balance is based on what relationships are accessible to them, and how burdensome they find a process. 
    \item Too much process (not enough leveraging of social relationships). When this happens, bureaucrats can end up resorting to use of social relationships to circumvent burdensome processes.
\end{itemize}
This optimization is like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve}{Laffer curve} in economics.

Minimal processes and subtle change may not be available.
The following sections describe why static process designs are the norm, the role of bureaucratic debt, and how to design for turnover of staff.
