Is the bureaucrat aiming for the "right" response or the option with the lower friction?
If that lower-friction option causes harm, who feels the suffering?
If there is no repercussion to the bureaucrat, then pick the easier path

examples:

Tax form notarized by family member. Tax office was going to accept the form even with the mistake 

Pour used engine oil down the drain or bring it to a recycling center 

Cleaning up after your dog on a public sidewalk

Having rules is insufficient, enforcement is also required
