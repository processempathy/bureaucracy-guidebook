Policies can seem overwhelming, especially when they are layered into cruft accumulating over time.Then you have a choice: deal with the cruft of existing policies, or find a new environment where policy hasn't built up yet.If the problem being addressed has the same complexity, then you'll likely need to evolve similar policesÂ which incurs the risk of making mistakes (discovering why those policies were needed, and how to craft them).
