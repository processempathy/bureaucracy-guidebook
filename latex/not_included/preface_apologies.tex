In my reflections and trying to draw lessons there is a risk of overanalysis. Sometimes a situation is merely happenstance, and sometimes trying to extract lessons from randomness is folly. Avoiding conjecture about conspiracy and malice is a fuzzy boundary when insufficient information is available. 

My experiences cannot be generalized to every situation. Some of the observations here may be analogous to your context if you squint. 


While this material is intended to be timeless and generic, it is culturally specific to the United States of America in the early twenty first century. 
There are cultural blindspots not addressed in this book because I did not encounter systemic hurdles in my career as financially privileged white male.
