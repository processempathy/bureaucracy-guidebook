Not all coordination in a bureaucracy is done with explicit communication

Some shared resources lack active bureaucrats and rely on signs or non-verbal unwritten rules to enforce policy.
Examples:
A low guardrail to cordon off an area. 
Bumps on a bench to make laying down uncomfortable and limit skateboarders from grinding 

Schelling's concept of focal points and thinking how others would think allow coordination without communication
