There are levels of enlightenment for bureaucrats. If you know the progression, you can step up to the next level more easily.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I feel bad.
    \item (complaint) I can't do what I want.
    \item (complaint) I can't do what I want in the way I want.
    \item (complaint) There is a problem.
    \item I have a solution.
    \item I have an implementation.
    \item I tried but my solution didn't work.
    \item (burnout) Life sucks but I get a pay check.
    \item I quit (in hopes of being more successful somewhere else).
\end{enumerate}
