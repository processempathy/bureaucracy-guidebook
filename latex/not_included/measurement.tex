A typical starting point for a challenging decision would be to collect data and then form a narrative based on that data. Surprisingly, some bureaucrats take the opposite view: Don't measure things; if you do you'll be held accountable for them. 

Setting aside the avoidance of accountability for a moment, there is reasoning behind the intent to not measure.   While there are ways to minimize this (e.g., not telling people what you're measuring), what you invest in measuring should be proxies for what the organization values.
