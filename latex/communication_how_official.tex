Communication within a bureaucratic organization occurs on a gradient of how official the information is. Examples of the gradient ordered from unofficial to official:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I just made this up and I have no authority.
    \item Based on my experience, ...
    \item Based on my training, ...
    \item I heard from someone else (folklore from a peer).
    \item I heard from someone in a position of authority.
    \item Referencing a written document.
    \item Referencing a written document that looks official.
    \item Referencing a written document that looks official with the signature of a person with a position of authority.
\end{itemize}
These indicators convey the relative importance of information for the bureaucrat.
