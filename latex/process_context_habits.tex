% Claim: you already have habits; these are similar to processes use by bureaucrats in organizations

If you haven't pondered bureaucratic policies and processes before, consider your own personal habits. You might eat at the same time every day, or you might go to bed at the same time. Those are both examples of personal policies. In the same way, bureaucrats in organizations seek routines to decrease uncertainty. 

Comparing bureaucratic processes for organizations to a person's habits is intended to make the concept relatable to your experiences. Both are routines which ease the burden of decision making. A habit can be intentional (e.g., my policy is to brush my teeth before going to bed), just as a process can be designed. Habits can be unconscious (e.g., arriving at work without recalling driving there), just as processes can arise without design. 

An intentional habit of an individual person is motivated by a personal policy. Similarly, bureaucrats acting on behalf of an organization apply processes that support the policies of the organization.
