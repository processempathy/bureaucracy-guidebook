\subsubsection*{Organization chart orientation
\label{sec:org-chart-orientation}}

A common method of describing relations within the bureaucracy is the organization chart (commonly the ``\gls{org chart}"). \iftoggle{glossaryinmargin}{\marginpar{[Glossary]}}{}%
Normally the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is at the top of the chart, middle management is in the middle, and managed employees are at the bottom. See Figure~\ref{fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top}\iftoggle{haspagenumbers}{ on page~\pageref{fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top}.}{.}

Artifacts like org charts subtly convey an organization's culture. 
% What's the point of this section? Is there a consequence, or is this just an observation?
There are emotional connotations to alternative layouts. You can alter expected relations (culture and norms) by playing with the orientation of the org chart.
Org chart orientation can be overanalyzed, so the exploration in this section is limited.

The point of thinking about org chart orientation is to frame how you perceive your supervisors, peers, and the bureaucrats you manage. Notice that the framing is embedded in the words -- prefixes super (over) and sub (under). 
These concepts inform what you expect from relations.
Do I seek support or direction and guidance from my boss? What do I expect from my boss? My peers? The people I oversee? What do I expect to provide them?

to the workers sets expectations for relations. 
Options for orientation are the conventional CEO at the top
(Figure~\ref{fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top}), 
CEO at the bottom (Figure~\ref{fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-bottom}),
CEO on the right (Figure~\ref{fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-leads}),
CEO on the left (Figure~\ref{fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-follows}),
CEO as the center of a star 
(for example, the diagram for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:League_of_Nations_Organization.png}{League of Nations} in 1930.)
