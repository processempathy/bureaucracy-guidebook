\section{Communication is Critical for Bureaucracy}
\Gls{bureaucracy} 
\marginpar{[Tag] Glossary}
is a system of distributed knowledge and distributed decision making. Distributed decision making relies on effective communication. Bureaucrats communicate by writing and speaking, both of convey incomplete information and are imprecise. The inability to be comprehensive and precise in communication means iteration is key when establishing a shared mental model of the situation and plan.


The dependence on iterative interactions means relationships matter for communication.

the value of an organization is proportional to the square of the number of people interacting in the organization. A team of 5 people is not just the aggregated skills of five individuals -- there's the synergy arising from ten bilateral relationships. Broadening your network of collaborators broadens your potential effectiveness and that of your fellow bureaucrats.

Suppose that you don't invest in relationships with your fellow bureaucrats. Then you'll be less likely to know what is happening in your organization, and you won't understand why certain decisions were made. Because of your confusion you might focus on your own self interests since that is what you have some control over and insight on. That doesn't leverage the potential synergy of collaboration, but at least you look busy. 

The analysis above applies to each person in the bureaucratic organization.

The consequence is that the organization's goals are not achieved when bureaucrats act independently. 
There is a way out of this: broadcast your intent to other people, be transparent with decisions, and share the results of your activities. That decreases the confusion other people may have about your actions and can improve effectiveness. You can make yourself and the organization more effective even when your investment in communication is not reciprocated.

Information within a bureaucracy shapes the relationships among bureaucrats. You have a choice: you can decide to not share information, you can be transparent, and you can be vulnerable.  
Not sharing information can harm or protect relationships. 
Being transparent conveys ``here's what is happening." Being vulnerable expands that to ``here's why that's happening or what might happen."
Each of those options informs how your coworkers, peers, management, and team members interpret their perception of your intent. Your communication shapes your reputation.


Another way communication alters bureaucratic organizations is when actions informed by locally-available information produce \hyperref[sec:failure-to-comm]{suboptimal results for participants}, as illustrated by the

The concept of ``locally-available information'' refers to communication among bureaucrats that facilitates delegation of work, allocation of resources, relationship creation/maintenance, and carrying out processes. Each bureaucrat benefits from gathering information that shapes their actions, but communication has a cost: time spent building and verifying consensus delays action. There is an opportunity cost when time is spent talking with people.
