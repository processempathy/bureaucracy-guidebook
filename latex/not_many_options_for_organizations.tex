\section{Not many Options for Organizations}

When complaining about the ineptitude of organizations (or more specifically, leaders, managers, subordinates, and coworkers), consider the variables available to be modified. As a thought exercise, what would it take to rebuild the organization you are in from scratch? 
\marginpar{$>>$ Thought Exercise}

Listing the levers available for enacting change to an organization is intended to emphasize the importance of personal interactions within bureaucracy. When you get frustrated with inefficiency, consider the systemic changes available -- there aren't that many. Options for restructuring the organization are limited, so the importance of your creativity and informal influence is dominant in determining the effectiveness of bureaucracy. Those factors relevant to Process Empathy are separate from having the right staff and being able to have adequate number of staff. 

Organizations comprised of bureaucrats have fewer options for change than individual bureaucrats. The choices an individual bureaucrat faces are described in the section on 
\hyperref[sec:dilemma-trilemma]{dilemmas}.
\marginpar{See page~\pageref{sec:dilemma-trilemma}.}
In comparison, the choices faced by the designers of an organization are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flatness of organizational hierarchy -- how many layers of oversight are there? Another way of arriving at the same structure is to ask how many employees there are per supervisor.
    \item Hierarchy split by function (all the lawyers in one team, all the engineers in one team, all the sales people in one team) or by product (mixing experts to solve a customer's problem)?

    \item Size of organization. More people allows for more specialization and requires more support. 
    \item Organizations are segmented into teams, and there are not many options for segmentation: create a new team, merge existing teams, or dissolve a team. Shuffling the structure of teams (referred to as re-organization) is a favorite hobby of executive leadership. The alignment of hierarchical structure with an organization's purpose is a change that is easy to point to as an accomplishment.

% * Add a new organization below: person who was an employee is now a manager and hires a bunch of people
% * Add a new peer team,
% * Add a new parent oversight organization above the current one
% * Unflatten an organization by inserting a new layer of management
    
    \item Organizations create processes for recurring tasks like hiring, promotion (pay or title), awards, compensation, recognition, professional training, and firing. Each of those has a set of design choices that inform the organization's culture.
\end{itemize}
In a government bureaucracy, the constraints of some incentives like pay and financial awards are set outside the organization. That further constrains the ability of bureaucrats to shape their organization's culture.

The organization may have policies and processes regarding hiring, promotion, training, and firing, but the decision may be made by team managers rather than top-level management. 

Enumerating the choices an organization faces is only relevant in the context of a desire to change. 
Individual bureaucrats can enact change, and subjects of bureaucracy can request improvement, but those are weak inputs. 
Organizations are accountable to their source of funding, not the subjects of bureaucracy or members of the organization. For example, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service}{Internal Revenue Service (IRS)} 
\index{exemplar!Internal Revenue Service (IRS)}
\index{Wikipedia!\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service}{Internal Revenue Service}}
is accountable to Congress, not the taxpayer or IRS employees. 

\subsection*{Not many options for Teams}

Similar to the limited number of options available for shaping organizations, the structural choices faced by a team are constrained. The relevance of listing what can be done is to again emphasize the importance of personal relationships for effective bureaucracy. 

Team managers might decide who gets hired and who gets promoted and who goes to what training and who gets fired. Though in some environments even that control is relegated to an external team. A team manager usually has decision-making authority regarding tasks the team works on. 

Accountability in the context of teams comes from person-to-person interactions. These can be either lateral (sideways) or parent-child (top-down) or child-parent (bottom-up)~\cite{2014_Jorgensen}. Each of these three categories has associated constraints.

The upward child-parent (bottom-up) communication is either inadequate (too few updates, not enough information, or insufficient context), relevant, or excessive. For example, a weekly or monthly report to multiple superiors may be inadequate. 

Finding the balance depends on the presenter knowing the individual audience members so that a tailored message is provided and then adapting to the specifics of the situation.

The downward parent-child communication either is inadequate (no direction provided or imprecise direction provided), provides actionable vision, or micromanagement. Finding the right balance and specificity requires insight into the communication needs on both sides of the relationship. 

For lateral interactions among team members, the tension between cooperation and competition manifests in struggles over money, staffing, products (output), and resources (inputs). Here ``resources''  refers to constraints like access to data, control of data, technology resources, hardware, floor space, and expertise.
