\section{Resources for Management\label{sec:resources-for-management}}

%Books on management might not seem applicable if you are not already in a management role.
Reading management books is helpful regardless of whether you are a manager, want to become a manager, or if you never want to become a manager. In all three cases, gaining awareness of best practices and alternative approaches benefits you as a bureaucrat and the people you coordinate with -- bosses, peer bureaucrats, subordinates, and subjects.


Reading lists outside the scope of this book on bureaucracy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://github.com/LappleApple/awesome-leading-and-managing}{Leading and managing}
    \item \href{https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-engineering-team-management}{Engineering team management}
    \item \href{https://github.com/pdfernhout/High-Performance-Organizations-Reading-List}{High Performance Organizations}
    \item \href{https://github.com/ankitjaininfo/awesome-managers}{Managers}
\end{itemize}

%Bureaucracy involves hierarchy, so understanding the mechanics and nuances of hierarchical roles is useful.
