My book sits between Lipsky's street level bureaucracy and Wilson's bureaucracy. 
I don't worry about politics, and I also don't worry about service oriented government workers who interact with clients.
In my personal experience as a bureaucrat I interact with neither customers nor Congressmen. 

Lipsky specifically distinguishes between the motives of the street level bureaucrat and the motives of management. Cite page 19

Both Lipsky and Wilson focus on government bureaucracy, whereas I believe bureaucracy is much more widespread in both public and private spheres
