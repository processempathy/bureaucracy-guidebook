%If you don't think of yourself as a bureaucrat, I hope to change your mind on this essential topic. 
If you have a negative impression of bureaucracy, I have bad news for you: bureaucracy is vital to society. The good news is that you can learn to skillfully navigate bureaucracy. A skilled bureaucrat is more effective and enhances the organization they are part of.

The framing of how you think about bureaucracy shapes what action you think is relevant for modifying your environment. If your mental model is not consistent with how bureaucracy works then your actions are likely to be wasted effort tackling irrelevant aspects. If your assumptions are wrong about how the system of bureaucracy works, then you will be trying to convert the system to meet your incorrect expectations. 
A more accurate model of bureaucracy allows you to be more effective and your changes to the system are more likely to succeed. 

Having a precise definition of bureaucracy enables a clearer discussion. 

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Definition}: Bureaucracy is a system for distributing shared resources, whether tangible or expertise, by subjective decision making of individual people using distributed knowledge and distributed decision making. 
\end{quote}

The concepts and techniques in this book are derived from this definition. For more exploration of this definition, see \S\ref{sec:define_bureaucracy}.

As a quick example of how this definition is distinct from conventional definitions\footnote{\href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bureaucracy}{Merriam-Webster's definition} focuses on government; the \href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bureaucracy}{Wikipedia entry} acknowledges non-governmental bureaucracy.}, I view government as an instance of bureaucracy; bureaucracy is not limited to government. 

Reasoning about the systems of bureaucracy is an accessible topic for everyone because we each have personal experience.
For example, one can argue that the systems of bureaucracy that we operate within is broken: participants are harmed and there is inequality. The counterargument is that observed bureaucratic behavior is how the system was designed to operate. There is a third argument: bureaucratic systems operate in a degraded mode (compared to what is possible). In this book I set aside the macro-scale behaviors of bureaucracy like the three arguments above and
focus on the human-scale interactions that drive bureaucracy.

The difficulties of bureaucracy are central  to large societies that depend on complex interactions of many people. The challenge of bureaucracy is widespread across a variety of governments in different societies, and bureaucracy is durable -- it has existed for hundreds if not thousands of years. Therefore, tackling the challenge of bureaucracy is exciting (there are many potential improvements) and crucial. 
%I enjoy pondering hard problems and then leveraging insights gained from reflection.
Being an effective bureaucrat is important because bureaucracy can be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication}{force multiplier} beyond what one person could accomplish on their own.

% Who this book is for

% from https://graphthinking.blogspot.com/2021/07/bureaucracy-book-outline.html
This book is for you if you are curious about the complex world we live in, or you are thinking about how to productively contribute to society, or you want impactful employment, or your job is not what you expected. If you're wondering why innovation is hard within a bureaucratic organization, this guidebook is intended to help you understand what the challenges are. Understanding the challenges means you can design ideas that are more likely to succeed.


% What you should expect reading this book: 
Every person in society is a participant in bureaucracy. The purpose of this book is to decrease the surprise of that experience and better arm you emotionally and intellectually for the toil of being a bureaucrat. With focused reflection and a good guidebook, you can improve your skills as a bureaucrat. 

Understanding bureaucracy spans academic disciplines - \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology}{psychology}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology}{sociology}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_behavior}{organizational dynamics}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration}{public administration}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology}{anthropology}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science}{political science}. Most bureaucrats have no formal training in any of these domains. This book is not written from the academic perspective; it is a guidebook to be read by bureaucrats and written by a bureaucrat. 

This book is not a defense of bureaucracy, nor is it intended to disparage bureaucrats or the system of bureaucracy. Instead, the intent of this book is to serve as a guide to bureaucracy-as-it-is. There are no hacks presented for circumventing bureaucracy; advice on being an effective member of a bureaucratic organization is provided.

This book does not focus on leadership, managing a team, being a team member, planning, time management, project management, advancing your career, promotions, or self-improvement. In the process of being a better bureaucrat some lessons may apply in those domains.

This book doesn't address personal stress caused by bureaucracy, how to decrease stress, or how to balance the activities of work and life-outside-work.  I do not address work conditions, pay, benefits, or retirement plans.


This book doesn't focus on citizens, political policy makers, oversight (e.g., Congress -- state or federal), competing organizations, contracts, the budget of an organization, fines and other regulatory punishments resulting from bureaucracy, policy enforcement, specific policies and regulations, formal arbitration or judicial resolution of disputes. For observations on those topics, see Wilson's Bureaucracy~\cite{1991_Wilson}.

This book doesn't address discrimination or harassment. I neglect differences of experience based on the race, gender, or socioeconomic status. This book doesn't address bad coworkers, abusive bosses, psychological defects of individuals, or malicious intent. I assume no traitors, spies, or \href{https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=750070}{saboteurs}.
% alternative source: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual
I do not address \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern}{dark patterns}; issues like lying, bribery \cite{2021_Ang}, and criminal behavior are not discussed. All these aspects happen whenever people interact; the challenges are not specific to bureaucracy. In this book I assume you are honest, and that other people are honest.  
I assume bureaucrats strive for fairness, though the particular definition of fairness may vary from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. 
Even with all these simplifying assumptions the complexities of bureaucracy arise. In this context of benign bureaucracy, guidance on how to be an effective bureaucrat is provided.


% What is the benefit of reading this book?
As a result of reading this book, you will be better able to recognize and navigate complex professional environments, both within your career and outside of work. The perspectives offered in this book can benefit you directly, whether by promotion of rank or title, increase in pay, successful completion of a project, or through decreased stress derived from improved understanding how the world operates. Being a more effective bureaucrat can also positively impact the causes you care about and the people you engage with.

The negative connotation of bureaucracy may lead you to reject the label of bureaucrat. Whether you intentionally reject the label or simply do not recognize that you are bureaucrat, self-recognition of your status matters. How you behave and what you think your responsibilities are depend on how you label yourself.
% If you do not recognize that you are bureaucrat, you're less likely to be successful interacting with those around you. 
If you don't think of yourself as a bureaucrat, then you won't be able to distinguish what is your own fault, what is the fault of your coworkers, what is the fault of management, and what is intrinsic to bureaucracy. 


Even people who are smart (e.g., they know history, they have memorized capital cities, they can do math) can struggle when faced with complex large-scale distributed systems comprised of humans. Thinking about complex large-scale systems is not part of the standard conventional education curriculum. This book will help you learn about bureaucracy and lead to an increased ability to identify patterns and apply relevant techniques.

% there's no avoiding the issue
Everyone is a bureaucrat because there are few alternatives to bureaucracy for a society. Gaining skills in navigating bureaucracy are helpful both for your own happiness and the well-being of a functioning society. 

Hoping that modern technology will eliminate or reduce bureaucracy is not a solution. Automation and computers merely obfuscate processes and make negotiation more challenging. Even with faster decisions and fewer humans, there is still reliance on humans to make decisions and design processes.

Simplifying interactions with other people merely as human relations is an easier perspective compared to considering bureaucracy as a complex system.
% this is also stated on page 24 of \cite{1991_Wilson}
The simplified view misses emergent phenomena and mischaracterizes the situation. As a result your effectiveness is decreased.



% my experience
% I wrote this book for a younger version of me.
% When I first started my job in a large organization I recognized differences between the expectations of the education system I had left and the challenges of a professional environment. Over the years I learned from my mistakes by reflecting on my (in)actions and the consequences. This approach has been an expensive education. My mistakes delayed progress and damaged relationships. The motive drive this book is to provide generalizations from my experiences which might benefit the reader.


% Caveats

%In my reflections and attempting to draw lessons there is a risk of overanalysis. Sometimes a situation is merely happenstance, and sometimes attempting to extract lessons from randomness is folly. Avoiding conjecture about conspiracy and malice is a fuzzy boundary when insufficient information is available. 

%My experiences cannot be generalized to every situation. Some of the observations here may be analogous to your context if you squint. 

Nothing in this book is domain specific, nothing is tied to engineering of products, and nothing is applicable solely in science research or policy development. While this material is intended to be timeless and generic, it is culturally specific to the United States of America in the early twenty first century. %There are cultural blindspots not addressed in this book because I did not encounter systemic hurdles in my career as financially privileged white male.

The definition of bureaucracy in \S\ref{sec:define_bureaucracy} is critical for the book, while \S\ref{sec:alternative_views_from_within} and \S\ref{sec:models-of-bureaucracy} are merely helpful. The essentials of bureaucracy described in \S\ref{fundamentals_of_b} will be familiar to experienced bureaucrats. 

Chapter~\ref{sec:bureaucracy-in-general} contains independent essays framing how to think about bureaucracy. 
These framings motivate the tips provided in \S\ref{sec:effective_bureaucrat}.

The core observations about the experience of a bureaucrat are in \S\ref{sec:dilemma_trilemma}. 

Chapter~\ref{b_made_of_humans} is the field guide. Each section is intended to stand independently. %The content is intended to spark contemplation.
