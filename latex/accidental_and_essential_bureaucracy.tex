\section{Bureaucracy as Accidental, Legacy, or Essential}
\gls{essential bureaucracy} is the minimum processes and staffing and skills necessary to address the complexity of the managing a community's access to a \gls{shared resource}. Achieving this minimum is tricky since the optimization can be with respect to resilience to change, resilience to edge cases, staff turn-over, speed experienced by consumer, financial cost, time spent by the organization, and number of staff. Miss any one of those and the bureaucracy is deemed inefficient.

Undesirable bureaucracy is categorized as either accidental or legacy. Accidental bureaucracy arises when someone misunderstands what is needed, or when skills of the bureaucrats involved are insufficient for the complexity a problem. Legacy bureaucracy occurs when the situation changes but the processes do not. Resolving each of these suboptimal conditions may seem easy: have better knowledge of the problem, assign the right people to the problem, and change processes as problems evolve. 

Having enough knowledge is often infeasible, especially for complex problems at large scale. Having the people with the right skills assumes that a pipeline of people with relevant talents exists and that people in the pipeline won't be poached to work on other challenges. Keeping up with evolving problems depends on having resources to change (beyond the maintenance baseline), and having a defined approach for changing the process.
