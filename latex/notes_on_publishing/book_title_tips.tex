#1: Choose a title to draw people in.

What’s the fastest way to achieve attention?

Get people to stop and look at your book.

Success here comes down to:
\item Make it eye-catching
\item Make it intriguing
\item Make them want to find out more


#2: Choose a subtitle to explain the title.

This is the formula I use over and over again:

“Title + Subtitle = I need to read this book”

The title caught their attention, now the subtitle must tell them:

• Who it's for
• What it's about
• What they'll get from reading


#3: Let your audience find you with keywords.

People who succeed here know that keywords matter.

People search on Amazon, so:

• Choose keywords with low competition
• Choose keywords with high search volume
• Choose your title before keywords, but be prepared to change it

#4: Make sure it's unique.

The people who master this know something 99% of people don’t.

Competitors can be your inspiration, but be DIFFERENT.

The faster you realize this + stop trying to be like them, the sooner you'll have a book that will help build your business.



#5: Make it short + memorable.

Finally, the most important tip of all.

All successful titles can be reduced down to this:

They must be brief + simple:

• Make it memorable
• Use plain language
• Make it easy to pronounce

Readers should remember + share your title.
