Blue type: Could be a problem if this is ever a 1-color (black) print book. Other colors should translate ok to a shade of black, but blue to black can be a problem (too faint).

Hyperlinks are not usable in a printed book. If links are relevant, will need to insert footnotes for URLs. 


From Brian Black:
Intentionally blank left-hand pages donâ€™t need running heads. This is probably a manual fix. If you ever go to print, let the printer know where the blanks fall.
