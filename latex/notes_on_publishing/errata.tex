When using Pandoc to convert latex to HTML, the glossary substitutions are incorrect. 
What renders correctly in PDF is not correct in HTML. 

Example:

\Gls{bureaucracy} involves the creation and execution of \glspl{policy}

Becomes, in PDF

Bureaucracy involves the creation and execution of policies

whereas in HTML the rendered text is

bureaucracy involves the creation and execution of policys
