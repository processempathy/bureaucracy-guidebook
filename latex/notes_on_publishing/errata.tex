ISSUE: Glossary doens't render for LATEX --> HTML

DESCRIPTION: When using Pandoc to convert latex to HTML, the glossary substitutions are incorrect. 
What renders correctly in PDF is not correct in HTML. 

Example:

\Gls{bureaucracy} involves the creation and execution of \glspl{policy}

Becomes, in PDF

Bureaucracy involves the creation and execution of policies

whereas in HTML the rendered text is

bureaucracy involves the creation and execution of policys


TODO: does PS -> HTML have this issue?

TODO: does DVI -> HTML have this issue?

***********************

ISSUE: the Preface is unnumbered in Latex, but get a number in HTML. As a result, the HTML chapter numbers are one more than the PDF
