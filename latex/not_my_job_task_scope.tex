\section{Not my Job: Task Scope}

% https://graphthinking.blogspot.com/2021/05/not-my-job-task-scope-and-collaboration.html

If I ask someone for help on a task that benefits our team, that person might respond that the task is ``not my job" and time spent on tasks like that ``gets in the way" of their progress. The interesting (emotionally rewarding) work is not that task.

`\href{https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scut}{Scut}' is medical slang for the non-clinical yet essential tasks that do not require a doctor's degree or expertise.
This is different from administrivia (administrative tasks).
%as ``scut'' would include taking out trash. 

% TODO: expand on
``Once I realized someone else has the same problem, I stopped worrying about it.'' Same as ``not my job."

The potential reasons for this reluctance to help include
\begin{itemize}
    \item Working on the task will not get them promoted.
    \item Their understanding of the scope of their job and their expertise does not include the task.
    \item The person don't know how to do the task and they don't want to learn.
\end{itemize}
In any case, progress for the individual is not aligned with the success of the team.
