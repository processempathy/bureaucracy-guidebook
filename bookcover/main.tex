If most people want to do the right thing, why do the organizations society relies on perpetually operate in suboptimal ways? Good people collaborating on complex challenges consistently yield less-than-ideal outcomes. Bureaucracy stifles innovation and delays progress.

\ \\
More immediate to you, your choices are constrained by the decisions of people you may not directly interact with. You lack control over information and actions you depend upon. Whatever  control you had decreases as the population grows and everyone is more intertwined with each other.
The need for coordination becomes more important as shared resources become scarcer.

\ \\
When you're faced with bureaucracy that ranges from mundane to Kafkaesque, this guidebook empowers you to be more effective. Insight on how to navigate organizations of people allows you to find better ways to reach your goals. 

\ \\
Whether you're in a growing startup company, looking for a stable job in a large corporation or government, or you're curious as to recurring patterns in complex organizations, this book will help you understand your environment and the people in it.
